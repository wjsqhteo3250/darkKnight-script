are you awake? no
what time is it? two o'clock almost tow o'clock
am or pm? you're not serious. not entirely.
it's afternoon. i know. what time is your flight?
7:40 to amsterdam. i haven't seen you for two weeks,
and you're leaving again this evening?
i know, i'll be gone for just a few days.
god, you're a sexy woman. what are you doing?
i'm not doing anything. they're gonna take me
out of here on a gurney. tell me something sexy.
i want you to put your hand up my dress.
but you're not wearing a dress.
what does that have to do with it?
it's something you like for me to say.
i know. but it has to be real, doesn't it?
why don't you just tell me what it is that you want me
to do to you? i want you to touch me. 
you want me to touch you where?
i want you to touch me down there. you do? i really do.
say it more sexy. i want you to touch me. are you wet?
yes. you really are. yes. god you're sopping. i know.
how did you get yourself into such a state?
from thinking about you. from thinking about me, what?
from thinking about your sweet face between my legs.
wait, wait, wait. i think i should go tidy up.
i don't want you to. slow, slow, slow.
how do you know how to do that?
from hanging out with really nasty girls.
you've ruined me, you know that? i hope so.
god, you have the most luscious pussy in all of christendom.
tell me what to do. you know what to do. tell me.
what if i shock you? too bad.
i want you to finger-fuck me. what? you heard me.
i can't believe you said that. believe it.
you're reached a whole new level of depravity,
haven't you? i thought i didn't mean that much to girls.
depends on the girl. i want you to stick your finger up me,
and find my spot, and push on it. oh, my god!
god, you are luscious. oh, my god.

do you like it because it reminds you of somewhere else?
that's not why i like it. i like it for itself.
it doesn't have to be like something else. no.
do i remind you of someone else? yes, you do.
someone you miss? someone who is dead.
i don't think i miss things.
i think to miss something is to hope that it will come back.
but it's not coming back.
i've always known that since i was a girl.
you don't think that's a bit cold?
i think truth has no temperature.
mmm. there it goes.

follow me, please.
good morning. i want her to have something that
she won't be uncomfortable wearing.
i don't wanna give her a diamond so big,
she'd be afraid to wear it.
she is probably more courageous than you imagine.
is this a pillow? no, it's an Asscher.
look at the corners. let's put it in the grading box.
the pillow has a slight arc to the sides.
it is a modern version of the old-mine cut.
let's look at the color. put it table-side down.
so you're looking through the pavilion?
yes, there's more to look through.
it appears to be yellow.
it's mitrogen that gives it the yellow.
the colors start with D. a D-stone has no color.
so, what am i looking at? H.
is that still a good color? that's a very good color.
the truth is that anything you can say about the
diamond is in the nature of a flaw.
a perfect diamond would be composed simply of light.
do you see the inclusion? no. 
it is small, what we would call a feather.
yes. i think i see it. so, it is graded what?
a vs1. some might grade it higher.
you might grade it higher. you like this stone?
oh, i like that stone. how many carats is it? 3.9.
it's expensive. tell me what you see.
remember, you're not looking for merit.
this is a cynical business. we seek only imperfection.
this is a 5-carat stone. tell me what you see.
the culet seems big. crown and pavilion don't fit.
the girdle comes out crooked. very good.
but there is no perfect diamond.
'en este mondo nada es perfecto', as my father would say.
you're sephardic. yes. do you know spain? i do.
and spain me. at one time, i thought she would
return from the grave, but that is not to be.
every country that has driven out the jews has
suffered the same fate. which is?
you don't want to hear. we should talk stones.
the most valued stone is the red diamond from the
argyle mines, so very rare.
i've seen two in a long life. a prize almost beyond belief.
i do wanna hear. well, i have to say,
there's no culture, save for the semitic culture, there.
the last know cultrue before that was the greek,
and there will be no culture after, nothing.
that's a bold claim.
the heart of any culture is to be found in the nature
of the hero. who is that man who is revered?
in the classical world, it is the warrior,
but in the western world, it is the man of god.
from moses to christ, the prophet, the penitent.
such a figure was unknown to the greeks, unheard of,
unimaginable. because there is only a man of god,
not a man of gods. and this god is the god of
the jewish people. there is no other god.
we see him... what is the word? purloined.
purloined in the west. how do you steal the god?
the jew beholds his tormentor dressed in the vestments
of his own ancient culture.
everything bears a strange familiarity.
the fit is always poor, and the hands are always
dripping blood. that coat? didn't that belong
to uncle haim? what about the shoes?
enough. i se your look. no more philosophy.
the stones themselves have their own view of things.
perhaps they are not so silent as you think.
they were piped up out of the earth
in a time before any withness was.
but here they are. let me show you.
this is a cautionary stone. although, i suppose
every diamond is cautionary.
a cautionary diamond. of course, why not?
it's not a small thing to wish for, however unattainable...
to aspire to the stone's endless destiny.
isn't that the meaning of adornment?
to enhance the beauty of the beloved... is to
acknowledge both her frailty,
and the nobility of that frailty.
we announce to the darkness that we will not be
diminished by the brevity of our lives.
that we will not thereby be made less.
you will see. 

afternoon, sir. thank you
looking good, counselor. chirs.
how you doing? good.
where's reiner? he's in there.
you don't have to worry about it.
yeah, but who paid for it?
i put the credit card down.
so obviously, i paid for it.
you paid for it? i don't care.
but you like it? i do like it.
i've never been to barbados.
are all the ladies as sexy as you?
it's a steaming pit of sexual abandon.
i don't believe you.
well, it used to be. i left.
come in. good morning, counselor.
good morning. malkina.
hola, guapo. hey.
how's laura? incredible.
