are you awake? no
what time is it? two o'clock almost tow o'clock
am or pm? you're not serious. not entirely.
it's afternoon. i know. what time is your flight?
7:40 to amsterdam. i haven't seen you for two weeks,
and you're leaving again this evening?
i know, i'll be gone for just a few days.
god, you're a sexy woman. what are you doing?
i'm not doing anything. they're gonna take me
out of here on a gurney. tell me something sexy.
i want you to put your hand up my dress.
but you're not wearing a dress.
what does that have to do with it?
it's something you like for me to say.
i know. but it has to be real, doesn't it?
why don't you just tell me what it is that you want me
to do to you? i want you to touch me. 
you want me to touch you where?
i want you to touch me down there. you do? i really do.
say it more sexy. i want you to touch me. are you wet?
yes. you really are. yes. god you're sopping. i know.
how did you get yourself into such a state?
from thinking about you. from thinking about me, what?
from thinking about your sweet face between my legs.
wait, wait, wait. i think i should go tidy up.
i don't want you to. slow, slow, slow.
how do you know how to do that?
from hanging out with really nasty girls.
you've ruined me, you know that? i hope so.
god, you have the most luscious pussy in all of christendom.
tell me what to do. you know what to do. tell me.
what if i shock you? too bad.
i want you to finger-fuck me. what? you heard me.
i can't believe you said that. believe it.
you're reached a whole new level of depravity,
haven't you? i thought i didn't mean that much to girls.
depends on the girl. i want you to stick your finger up me,
and find my spot, and push on it. oh, my god!
god, you are luscious. oh, my god.

do you like it because it reminds you of somewhere else?
that's not why i like it. i like it for itself.
it doesn't have to be like something else. no.
do i remind you of someone else? yes, you do.
someone you miss? someone who is dead.
i don't think i miss things.
i think to miss something is to hope that it will come back.
but it's not coming back.
i've always known that since i was a girl.
you don't think that's a bit cold?
i think truth has no temperature.
mmm. there it goes.

follow me, please.
good morning. i want her to have something that
she won't be uncomfortable wearing.
i don't wanna give her a diamond so big,
she'd be afraid to wear it.
she is probably more courageous than you imagine.
is this a pillow? no, it's an Asscher.
look at the corners. let's put it in the grading box.
the pillow has a slight arc to the sides.
it is a modern version of the old-mine cut.
let's look at the color. put it table-side down.
so you're looking through the pavilion?
yes, there's more to look through.
it appears to be yellow.
it's mitrogen that gives it the yellow.
the colors start with D. a D-stone has no color.
so, what am i looking at? H.
is that still a good color? that's a very good color.
the truth is that anything you can say about the
diamond is in the nature of a flaw.
a perfect diamond would be composed simply of light.
do you see the inclusion? no. 
it is small, what we would call a feather.
yes. i think i see it. so, it is graded what?
a vs1. some might grade it higher.
you might grade it higher. you like this stone?
oh, i like that stone. how many carats is it? 3.9.
it's expensive. tell me what you see.
remember, you're not looking for merit.
this is a cynical business. we seek only imperfection.
this is a 5-carat stone. tell me what you see.
the culet seems big. crown and pavilion don't fit.
the girdle comes out crooked. very good.
but there is no perfect diamond.
'en este mondo nada es perfecto', as my father would say.
you're sephardic. yes. do you know spain? i do.
and spain me. at one time, i thought she would
return from the grave, but that is not to be.
every country that has driven out the jews has
suffered the same fate. which is?
you don't want to hear. we should talk stones.
the most valued stone is the red diamond from the
argyle mines, so very rare.
i've seen two in a long life. a prize almost beyond belief.
i do wanna hear. well, i have to say,
there's no culture, save for the semitic culture, there.
the last know cultrue before that was the greek,
and there will be no culture after, nothing.
that's a bold claim.
the heart of any culture is to be found in the nature
of the hero. who is that man who is revered?
in the classical world, it is the warrior,
but in the western world, it is the man of god.
from moses to christ, the prophet, the penitent.
such a figure was unknown to the greeks, unheard of,
unimaginable. because there is only a man of god,
not a man of gods. and this god is the god of
the jewish people. there is no other god.
we see him... what is the word? purloined.
purloined in the west. how do you steal the god?
the jew beholds his tormentor dressed in the vestments
of his own ancient culture.
everything bears a strange familiarity.
the fit is always poor, and the hands are always
dripping blood. that coat? didn't that belong
to uncle haim? what about the shoes?
enough. i se your look. no more philosophy.
the stones themselves have their own view of things.
perhaps they are not so silent as you think.
they were piped up out of the earth
in a time before any withness was.
but here they are. let me show you.
this is a cautionary stone. although, i suppose
every diamond is cautionary.
a cautionary diamond. of course, why not?
it's not a small thing to wish for, however unattainable...
to aspire to the stone's endless destiny.
isn't that the meaning of adornment?
to enhance the beauty of the beloved... is to
acknowledge both her frailty,
and the nobility of that frailty.
we announce to the darkness that we will not be
diminished by the brevity of our lives.
that we will not thereby be made less.
you will see. 

afternoon, sir. thank you
looking good, counselor. chirs.
how you doing? good.
where's reiner? he's in there.
you don't have to worry about it.
yeah, but who paid for it?
i put the credit card down.
so obviously, i paid for it.
you paid for it? i don't care.
but you like it? i do like it.
i've never been to barbados.
are all the ladies as sexy as you?
it's a steaming pit of sexual abandon.
i don't believe you.
well, it used to be. i left.
come in. good morning, counselor.
good morning. malkina.
hola, guapo. hey.
how's laura? incredible.
that sounds about right.
nice lady, nice lady.

i assume that she's not privy to your
newest business venture.
she's not. and your lady? yeah.
yeah, what? i don't know what she knows.
i don't wanna know.
you don't trust her?
jesus, counselor. she's a woman.
i don't mean to sound that cold.
i just mean that, where men are concerned,
they've got their own agenda.
i always liked smart women.
but it's been an expensive hobby, you know?
yeah. do you know what all that stuff is?
mostly, yeah. anything i don't know,
i can ask her. which worries me even more.
hmm. you never told me what happened
with you and the lovely clarissa.
ms. clarissa of the extraordinary body.
she used to go around with no bra.
those firm nipples in her blouse or t-shirt.
i think in the end, it was jealousy that undid us.
jealousy? yeah, she was getting more pussy
than i was. is that true? i think so probably, yeah.
i have to say that for a girl who liked girls,
she took an extraordinary interest
in the male member.
she sucked on it so hard
it finally corrected my vision.
she left me for this good-looking black woman.
whoo. had a boyfriend. played for the oilers.
nice chap. nice chap.
we met once for drinks at this club in dallas
to discuss our mutual plight.
he was taking it rather poorly, i have to say.
women do better, don't they?
maybe they have more practice at it.
yeah, well my guess is that in most cases,
if you still have the woman
you're weeping over,
you'll be weeping harder. mm-hmm.
so, is this place secure? who knows?
i don't speak in arraignable phrases anywhere.
there's scrambler on the phone, but still,
there's a lot of smart people out there.
of course, anybody who thinks he's the smartest
is on his way to the slam.
would that be me? no, no.
although, i have to say that i always thought
a law degree was a license to steal
and that you, for one, hadn't really capitalized on it.
you're not the straight dude people
think though, are you?
i guess not.
i don't mean the caper, i mean you.
women like you.
all right.
do you know what they like about you?
i'm a good fuck? right!
no, they can sniff out the moral dilemma.
the paradox.
moral dilemma.
yeah, they're drawn to it. not sure why.
maybe it's just that lacking any
moral sense themselves
they're fascinated by it in men.
men are attracted to flawed women, too of course
but their illusion is that they can fix them.
women don't wanna fix anything.
they only wanna be entertained.
the truth about women is you can do
anything to them except bore them.
well, there's nothing about laura
that i would wanna fix.
maybe not.
do you think she knows things about me
that i don't know about myself?
jesus, counselor, i'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.
yeah. okay.
if you pursue this road
that you've embarked upon
you will eventually come to moral decisions
that will take you completely by surprise.
you won't see it coming at all.
i don't intend to take this up as a trade.
yeah, one-time deal, right?
which you've heard a thousand times.
no, but a few.
what usually happens is that
after a couple of deals
they know more than you do and
they set up shop across the street.
and how does that work out for them?
not well.
so, that would be a moral issue.
not for me.
or for your associates.
yeah, well
they have a real aversion to mixing
business with pleasure.
do you know what a bolito is?
no. a bolo is one of those skinny neckties
or one of those things you throw in argentina.
yeah, right.
no. in this case, it's a mechanical device
and it has this small electric motor
with this rather incredible compound gear
that retrieves a steel cable.
battery-driven.
and the cable is made out of some unholy alloy
almost impossible to cut it.
and it's in a loop.
and you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away.
no one ever even sees you
and pulling the cable activates the motor
and the noose starts to tighten
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.
it cuts the guy's head off.
yeah, well, it can.
there's nothing he can do.
no. jesus. yeah.
how long does it take?
oh three, four minutes, five maybe
it depends on your collar size.
you're shitting me.
no, no, no
it's just that there's no easy way
to turn the thing off, or reason to.
it just keeps running until the noose
closes completely and then
it self-destructs.
actually, you're probably dead
in less than a minute.
from strangulation?
no. the wire cuts through the
carotid arteries
and then sprays blood all over the spectators
and everybody goes home
sweet. yeah, sweet.
think about it, counselor.
so where does all this beheading 
shit come from? you never used to see that.
i think it's blown in here from the east.
meaning the east?
yeah. you put nine mexicans and an arab in a room,
and give them each 100 bollars and
come back in a few hours,
who do you think is gonna be holding the grand?
so you gearing up to do business
with them down the road?
the arabs? yeah. no, no.
why's that?
because they don't need your money.

do you have a dog?
do i have a dog? yes.
no, ma'am. oh.
i don't have a dog. okay.
these are for me.
for you?
yes, ma'am. it's a diet.
a diet?
see, i probably shouldn't even be telling you this.
i mean, i've tried a couple of times,
and i gotta say it works pretty good.
i mean, you don't really eat.
when you get hungry, you just pop
a couple of these bad boys.
i carry a baggy full around with me.
last time, i lost 27 pounds in 30 days.
i'd pretty much recommend it to anybody.
these diets you read about.
i know this works.
i mean, but of course, like anything else,
you gotta use your head.
time befor, i woke up in the hospital.
but you just gotta keep your mind on
your business like anything else.
if you wanna lose weight, this is it.
after a few days, 
you don't even want anything else.
i'd absolutely recommend it to anybody.
but you said you woke up in the hospital.
what happened?
did you get a systemic reaction or what?
no, ma'am, it wasn't anything like that.
i was sitting in the street licking my balls,
and a car hit me.
take care now. you hear?

what? yeah? well, too bad.

here you go, ma'am. thank you.
enjoy your meal. thank you.
i have something to discuss with you...
and i'm a bit scared. hmm.
have you been bad? no.
actually, i don't have that much to discuss, so...
let me just give you this...
and tell me what you think.
will you?
don't leave me hanging, here.
yes, i will!
try it.
what, you didn't know?
i knew... but i was scared anyway.
that's good.
it's so beautiful.
you are a glory.
i'm a glory? yes.
as in "glorious." you're a glorious woman.
and you're a man of impeccable taste.
sorry, i shouldn't have said that.
you can't take it back. here.
i intend to love you until i die.
me first. not on your life.

that's a nice ring. how many carats is it?
i don't know. you don't know? no.
you've gotta be kidding me.
no, i don't know. let me see it.
no, take it off. hmm.
it's a 3.5 carat. maybe 3.8.
it's a nice stone. it's asscher cut.
thank you. good color.
probably an F, or a G.
nothing visible, so at least a vs2.
wanna know how much it's worth? no.
you really don't, do you?
i really don't
so, have you set a date? not yet.
i really wanna get married in the church.
and he's okay with that.
he was married before,
so i thought that would be a problem.
but the church doesn't recognize other marriages,
are you nervous? a little bit.
sometimes i am.
so, you're a church lady?
i go. it's important to me.
and what about confession? yeah.
well, maybe not so much.
does the priest ever ask you about sex?
he doesn't ask, but you're supposed to
tell him everything.
and all the nasty shit you did...
you're just supposed to pretend like
you're never gonna do it again, right?
i guess. strange.
and suppose you've done something like really nasty?
he doesn't press you for the details?
i don't think so.
you're blushing. uh-uh.
okay, we can change the subject.
we'll talk about my sex life.
you're teasing.
just rattling your cage. what a world.
do you think the world is strange?
i meant yours.

hello? reiner, are you there?
counselor. i think i'm in.
you can't think, counselor.
you're in or you're out.
all right, i'm in. and thanks.
don't thank me yet.
i won't say, "i hope you know what you're doing"
because you don't.
but, money problems are serious problems.
you keep telling yourself it's not as bad as it appears
and then one morning, you realize it's worse.
am i close? yeah, my back is against the
fucking wall, man.
i believe you. do you have the cash?
i'll have it thursday. all right.
i'll call westray and set it up.

counselor. westray.
it's not dark enough in here for you? wow.
that's a dandy. what happened?
confrontation with a doorman.
confrontation? jesus. what did you say to him?
i think i told him that he was not to take it personally
but he should go fuck himself.
what did he say to that?
he said, "i'm gonna hurt you, white person."
what will you have?
i'll have a heineken. make it two.
i didn't know you got into donnybrooks.
i don't. anyway, it was in another country.
and besides, the wretch is dead.
no, but i sent a pair of reliable chaps to speak with him
bloody expensive, too.
you surprise me.
counselor, i'm just a middle man.
i know the smallest crumb can devour us.
you learn not to let anything pass.
you can't afford to.
i should keep that in mind.
you might keep that in mind. so, fire away.
