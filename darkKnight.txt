Three of a kind. Let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?
two guys on the roof. Every guy
gets a share Five shares is
plenty.
Six shares. Don't forget the guy who
planned the job.
He thinks he can sit it out 
and still take a slice i know why
they call him the Joker.
so Why do they call him the Joker?
I heard he wears make-up.
Make-up?
Yeah. To scare people. you know War paint.
all right, everybody, hands up, heads down!
i said, hands up heads down!
let's go pal, i'm making a withdrawal here.
i said hands up -no
Here comes the silent alarm.
And there it goes. 
heads down! all right, tootsie, 
you're taking a dive with me.
down i said stay down there
don't hurt me
That's funny. It didn't dial out to 911- it was
trying to reach a private number.
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.
sit down down
down i said stay down there
Obviously, we don't want you doing
anything with your hands other than
holding on for dear life.
on the ground stay on the ground
nobody make a move nobody stay down
yeah! you have any idea who you're stealing from?
you and your friends are dead.
he's out, right?
Where did you learn to count?!
They wired this thing up with 5,000
volts. What kind of bank does that?
A mob bank. i Guess the Joker's as
crazy as they say.
Where's the alarm guy?
Boss told me when the guy was done I
should take him out. One less share. right?
Funny, he told me something
similar...
he what? no! no!
that's a lot of money...
If this joker guy was so smart he'd
have had us bring a bigger car.
I'm betting the Joker told you to
kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
no no No. I kill the bus driver.
Bus driver? What bus driver? 
school's out time to go
that guy's not getting up is he?
that's a lot of money
what happened to the rest of guys?
you Think you're smart, huh? the
guy that hired youse he'll just do the same
to you...
oh, Criminals in this town
used to believe in things...
Honor. Respect. look at you. What do you
believe in, huh? What do you believe in?
I believe that what doesn't kill
you...
...simply makes you stranger.

Mr Mayor, you were elected in a
campaign to clean up the city... when
are you going to start?
oh my god, i believe i already have
Like this so-called Batman- we're hearing
he's doing some good,
that criminals are running scared...
but I say. 

No, man. I don't like it tonight.
What're you, superstitious? You got
more chance of winning the powerball
than running into him...

that's simply just not true
i'm told that our men in the major cirmes unit are close
to an arrset

Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
closing in on the Batman.
The investigation is ongoing.

the process of cleaning up the streets is a long one
i pledged in my campaign, uh to have

Ever intending to see your wife
again, Lieutenant?
I thought you had to go look after
your mother, detective.
checked her back into the hospital.
I'm sorry.
so He hasn't shown up?
Often doesn't. But I like reminding
everybody that he's out there.
Why wouldn't he come?
Hopefully... Because he's busy.

That's why we bring dogs.
My little princes...
please they're crawling in my mouth
please i beg you get them off
look what your drugs do to my customers.
Buyer beware...
I told you my compound would
take you places. I never said they'd
be places you wanted to go.
My business , repeat customers.
you don't like what I have to
offer, you can buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left anyone to
buy from.
my dogs are hungry, pity there's only one of you...
what? -that's not him
Loose the dogs!
that's more like it

don't let me find you out here again
We're trying to help you!
I don't need help.
Not my diagnosis.
What gives you the right?! What's
the difference between you and me?!
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

everybody back now!
He can't resist showing us his face.
What's he hiding under that makeup?
can we get a minute people please?
Him again. Who are the others?
Another bunch of smalltimers.
Some of the marked bills I gave you.
My detectives have been making drug
buys with them for weeks. This bank
was another drop for the mob. That
makes five we found the
bulk of their dirty cash.
Time to move in.
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
What about this Joker guy?
One man or the entire mob? He can wait.
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.
Do you trust him?
Be hard to keep him out.
I hear he's as stubborn as you.

Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
and you can swap not sleeping in a
penthouse for not sleeping in a
mansion.
Whenever you stitch yourself up you do make
a bloody mess.
yeah it makes me learn from my mistakes.
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.
My armor... I'm carrying too much
weight- I need to be faster.
I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
it was a dog. -huh?
it was A big dog. There were more copycats
last night, Alfred. With guns.
why don't you hire them take the weekend off.
that wasn't exactly what I had in
mind when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know. But things have improved
Look at the new District Attorney...
I am. Closely. need to know if he can be trusted.
Are you interested in his character... or his social circle?
Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.
If you ever took one, I might.
Know your limits, Master Wayne.
Batman has no limits.
Well, you do, sir.
well can't afford to know them.
And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?
We all know how much you like to say
'I told you so'.
on That day, Master Wayne, even I won't 
want to. Probably.

Sorry I'm late, folks.
Where were you?
Worried you'd have to step up?
harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
take it. Tails, he's all yours.
yeah? You wanna flip a coin to see who leads?
it's My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.
i wouldn't leave something like that up to chance
I don't. I make my own luck.
all rise. the honorable judge freel presiding 
I thought the DA just played golf
with the Mayor, things like that.
Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
someone must've stepped up to run the
so-called family.
Is that man in this courtroom today?
Could you identify him for us, please?
You win, counselor. It was me.
I've a sworn statement from you
that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
the new head of the Falcone crime
family.
Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
brains of the organization.
order.
Permission to treat the witness as hostile?
Hostile? I'll show you hostile.
carbon fiber 28 caliber. Made in China.
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.
get him out of here.
But, your honor, I'm not done...

We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni,
so we won't be able to charge him,
but the fact they're trying to kill you
means we're getting to them.
i'm Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm
fine by the way.
come on Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.
you're not getting shot at, you're
not doing your job right.
but you know if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day off...
Can't. I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.
oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually try to be nice.

i hear you got a hell of a right cross. 
it's a Shame Sal's going to walk.
yeah, Well, good thing about the mob is
they keep giving you second chances.
Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
We liaise with various agencies
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.
what about that floodlight on top of M.C.U.?
If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment... 
i suggest you take them up with maintenance, counselor.
I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars. But the mob
is still getting its money out. I
think you and your "friend" have
found the last game in town and
you're trying to hit 'em where it
hurts: their wallets. it's Bold. You
gonna count me in?
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.
Gordon, I don't like that you've got
your own special unit, and I don't
like that it's full of cops I
investigated at internal affairs.
If I didn't work with cops you'd
investigated while you were making
your name at I.A.- I'd be working
alone. I don't get political points
for being an idealist- I have to do
the best I can with what I have.
You want me to back warrants for
search and seizure on five banks
without telling me what we're after?
I can give you the names of the
banks.
Well, that's a start. I'll get you
your warrants. But I want your
trust.
You don't have to sell me, Dent. We
all know you're Gotham's white knight.
yeah well, I hear they have a different
name for me down at M.C.U..
i wouldn't know about that

In China Lau security investments stands for
dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese
venture with Wayne Enterprises will
be a powerhouse.
Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
expressing our own excitement...
Sir, I know that Mr.Wayne is curious about how
his trust fund gets replenished but
frankly... this is embarrassing.
You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
It's done- the numbers are solid.
Do them again. Wouldn't want the trust
fund to run out, now would we?

Another long night?
This joint venture was your idea, and
the consultants love it, but I'm not
convinced. Lau's company has grown by 8 percent
annually, like clockwork. his revenue stream must be
off the books. Maybe even illegal.
OK. Cancel the deal.
You already knew.
just needed a closer look at their books.
Anything else you can trouble me for?
I need a new suit.
Three buttons is a little nineties. mr.wayne.
I'm not talking the fashion,
Mr.Fox, so much as function.
You wanna be able to turn your head?
Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
I'll see what I can do.

took three weeks to get a
reservation here and I had to tell them I
work for the government.
Really?
This city health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.
Rachel! Fancy that.
Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.
natasha are you the prima..?
prima ballerina for the moscow ballet
wow harvey's taking me next week.
really so you're into ballet?
Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
the famous bruce wayne rachel's told me everything
about you
i certainly hope not
so let's put a couple tables together.
I'm not sure that they'll let us
oh They should! I own the place.
how could you want to
raise children in a city like this?
well I was raised here. I turned out OK.
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
our new D.A. you might wanna figure
out where your jurisdiction ends.
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante...
Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.
Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
officials, not a man who thinks he's
above the law.
Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
We did. All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city.
But this is a democracy, Harvey.
When their enemies were at the gates,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the
city. It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered public service.
harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar. 
He never gave up his power.
okay fine you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain. Look,
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life
How could he? Batman's looking for someone to take
up his mantle.
Someone like you, Mr.Dent?
Maybe. If I'm up to it.
what if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader?
If I were sneaking out every night
someone would've noticed by now.
Well, i'm sold me, Dent. 
I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.
That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
not up for reelection for three years. 
no you don't understand. One
fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
need another cent.

what The hell is this...?
As you're all aware, one of our deposits was
stolen. A relatively small amount: 68 million.
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
purple suit and make-up. He's not
the problem- he's a nobody.
The problem is our money being
tracked by the cops.
Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
sources we know that police have
indeed identified our banks using
marked bills and are planning to
seize your funds today And since the
enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
competitors out of business, I'm your
only option.
So what do you propose?
Moving all deposits to one secure
location. Not a bank.
Where, then?
no one can know but me.
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you everyone's money
would be at stake.
What stops them getting to you?
I go to HongKong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.
how soon can you move the money
i already have
for obvious reasens, i couldn't wait for you permission
rest assured, your money is safe
 
and I thought my jokes were bad.
Give me one reason why I shouldn't have
my boy here pull your head off.
How about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
ta-da! it's gone
oh And by the way, the suit it wasn't
cheap. You ought to know. You bought it.
Sit. I want to hear proposition.
let's wind the clocks back a year
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
i mean, What happened? Did your balls drop off? hm?
you See, a guy like me
A freak.
A guy like me... look listen. I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem.. group therapy
sessions in broad daylight. I know
why you're afraid to go out at night.
the Batman. see batman has shown Gotham your true
colors. unfortunately Dent, he's just the beginning.
And as for the television's so-called plan- Batman
has no jurisdiction. He'll find him
and make him squeal.
I know the squealers when i see them and..
What do you propose?
It's simple. we, uh, Kill the Batman.
If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
if you're good at something, never do it for free.
How much you want?
Half.
you're crazy.
no i'm not
if we don't deal with this now, soon little
Gambol here won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma
Enough from the clown.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.
You think you can steal from us and
just walk away? 
yeah
I'm putting the word out- 5 hundred grand for this clown
dead. A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners, first.
all right. so listen why don't you give me a call
when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously
here's my card

You're a hard man to reach.
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
asked, I could have taken his passport- 
I told you to keep me in the loop.
All that was left in the vaults were the marked bills- 
they knew we were coming! As soon as your
office got involved,
My office?! You're sitting down there
with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..
Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your
rookie cold on a racketeering beef.
Don't try to cloud the fact that
clearly Maroni's got people in your
office, Dent.
We need Lau back, but the Chinese
won't extradite a national under any
circumstances.
If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing.
We're going after the mob's life
savings. Things will get ugly.
I knew the risk when I took this
job, lieutenant. How will you get him back, anyway?
He does that.

Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.
I'm sure that you've always wanted to go
to Hong Kong.
What's wrong with a phone call?
I think Mr.Lau deserves a more personal touch.

now For high altitude jumps, you're gonna need
oxygen and stabilizers. well I must say, compared to your usual requests,
jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
what about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent.
Without it landing.
now That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.
The CIA had a program back in the '60s for
getting their people out of hot spots Called Sky Hook. 
we could look into that
yeah
okey now
Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers for flexibility...
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile...
Perhaps you should read the instructions, first.
yeah
Now, there is a trade-off...
separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable
to knives and gunfire
We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?
How will it hold up against dogs?
you talking rottweilers or chihuahuas?
should do fine against cats.

I found one. In Arizona. a Very nice    
man said he could have it up and running in a week,
And he takes cash. What about the flight crew?
South Korean smugglers. They run
flights into Pyongyang, below radar
the whole way. Did you think of an alibi?
Oh, yes.

I believe this is your plane sir
You look tired, Alfred. you'll be all right without me?
If you can tell me the Russian for
'apply your own bloody suntan lotion.’

yo gambol, Somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.
they brought the body.
So. Dead that's five hundred
How about alive?
you Wanna know how I got these scars? My
father was a drinker and a fiend. and one night,
he goes off crazier than usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.
He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit.
So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, 
laughing while he does it.
he Turns to me and he says 'why so
serious?' he Comes at me with the knife-
'why so serious?' he Sticks the blade in my mouth- 
'Let's put a smile on that face' and...
Why so serious?
Now, our operation is small, but
there is a lot of potential for
aggressive expansion... so which of
you fine gentlemen would like to join
our team? oh there's Only one spot
open right now so we're gonna have
try-outs. Make it fast.

Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox! Mr.Lau
regrets he is unable to greet you in
person today. 
I understand!
for security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to
check in your mobile.
of course.
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding with the Gotham
police force... I couldn't let such
a thing threaten my company. 
of course  
A businessman of your stature will
understand and.. with you here... now we can continue.
Well, i do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr.Lau. But
We do not allow cell phones in here
Sorry. Forgot I had it. no, i really
come to tell you that our business deal has to be put
on hold. you see, we can't afford to be seen to do
business with...whatever it is you're accused of being.
i'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr.Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think that he was
deliberately wasting your time.
Just accidentally wasting it.
That's very good mr.lau "accidentally".
Very good. 

There's a better view from the peak tram.
How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?
Restricted. Lau is holed up in there
good and tight. 
What's this?
I had R and D work it up- it sends
out a high frequency pulse records the
response time for mapping an environment.
Sonar. Just like a..
Submarine. mr. wayne Like a submarine.
And the other device?
it's In place. Mr.Wayne? Good luck.

look, Give us the money and we'll talk about
making a deal
The money is the only reason I'm still alive.
oh, You mean when they find out that you've
helped us they're gonna kill you?
Are you threatening my client?
No, I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.
As will everyone. no? okay.
Enjoy your time in County, Mr.Lau.
Wait. I won't give you the money, 
but I'll give you my clients. All of them.
You were a glorified accountant- 
what could you possibly have on all of them that we
could charge?
I'm good with calculation- I handled
all their investments. One big pot.

got it. One minute 
RICO. If they pooled their money
we can charge them all as one criminal conspiracy.
Charge them with what?
In a RICO case if you can charge one of their 
conspirators with a felony
We can charge all of them with it. That's great

Mr.Lau, what kind of details do you have about this
communal fund? Ledgers,
notebooks...?
Immunity, protection and a chartered
plane back to Hong Kong.
after you testify in open court.
and i'm just curious. with all your clients locked up,
what's gonna happen with all that money?
Like I said- I'm good with calculation.

He can't go to County. I'll keep him
here in the holding cells.
What is this Gordon, your fortress?
well, You trust them over at County?
I don't trust them here.
Lau stays.

well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements...but I'm sure glad he's back.
put the word out. We hire the clown.
He was right. We have to fix real problem. Batman.
i'm not aware of any participation about batman
Our boy looks good on the tube.
You sure you wanna embarrass me in
front of my friends, Lieutenant?
Don't worry, they're coming, too.
have a nice trip, see you next fall

seven hundred twelve counts of extortion
eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering
two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.
five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction
of justice
how do the defendants plead?
order in the court

five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once
How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.
but Even if you blow enough smoke to get
convictions out of Surrillo, you're gonna
set a new record at appeals for
quickest kick in the ass.
It won't matter. The head guys make
bail, sure... but the mid-level guys,
they can't, they can't afford to
be off the streets long enough for
trial and appeal. They'll cut deals
that include some jail time. Think
of all you could do with 18 months of
clean streets.
mr. mayor, you can't
no get out both of you sit down
The public likes you, That's
the only reason that this might fly.
But that means it's on you. They're
all gonna come after you, now. and Not just
the mob... politicians, journalists,
cops- anyone whose wallet's about to
get lighter. Are you up to it?
You better be. because They get anything on
you...and those criminals are back
on the streets Followed swiftly by you and me jesus

I think your fundraiser will be a
great success, sir.
And why do you think I wanna hold
a party for Harvey Dent?
oh I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself and the
scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try
to impress Miss Dawes.
Very droll. But very wrong.
Actually it's Dent. 
...Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers be aware: the image is disturbing.

Tell them your name.
Brian Douglas.
Are you the real Batman?
No.
then Why do you dress up like him?
because He's a symbol that we don't have
to be afraid of scum like you...
yeah you do, Brian. You really do.
so You think Batman's made Gotham a better place? hm?
Look at me.
LOOK AT ME!
you see This is how crazy Batman's made
Gotham. You want order in Gotham?
Batman must take off his mask, and
turn himself in.
oh and Every day he doesn't people will die.
Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.

Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld, scared
stiff by the trust fund brigade.
i'll be back. rachel
A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?
Thank you Alfred, right?
that's right sir.
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life?
Not yet, sir.
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
Oh, you have no idea.
i'm Sorry that I'm late- i'm glad to see that you
all got started without me! now where is harvey? where?
harvey dent the man of the hour.
where's rachel dawes?
she is my oldest friend. come here you know When
rachel first told me that she was dating Harvey
Dent, I had one thing to say... the
guy from those god-awful campaign
commercials?
'I Believe in Harvey Dent.'yeah Nice
slogan, Harvey. but it caught
Rachel's attention. and then I
started to pay attention to Harvey,
and all that he's been doing as our new
D.A., and you know what? I believe
in Harvey Dent. i believe that On his watch, Gotham
can feel a little safer. A little
more optimistic. look at this face.
this is the face of gotham's bright future.
to harvey dent let's hear it for him

Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you're making fun
of him. But I do.
no I meant every word.
you know That day that you once told me about, 
when Gotham would no longer needs Batman. It's coming.
bruce You can't ask me to wait for that.
It's happening now- Harvey is that hero.
He locked up half of the city's
criminals, and he did it without
wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero with a face.
You can throw a party, Wayne, 
I'll give you that. Thanks again.
Mind if I borrow Rachel?

lieutenant That Joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..
Any matches?
All three.
The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
The Joker's telling us who he's
targeting- get a unit over to Surrillo's
house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get
them both into protective custody.
Where's the Commissioner?
City hall.
Seal the building. No one in or out
till I get there.
got it

Gordon, what are you up to?
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
I'm sorry, sir. We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

These are dangerous people, Judge.
yeah but you're not giving me off a lot of information
Even we don't know where you're going.
take the envelope, get in, open it.
it'll tell you where you're headed

You cannot leave me alone with these people.
The whole mob's after you and you're
worried about these guys?
yeah, Compared to this, the mob doesn't
scare me.

gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so
take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats.
i found the appropriate response to these situations
a long time ago

them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
yeah, i bet.
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing. about who
you wanna spend the rest of your life with...
That's a pretty big commitment.
Not if the mob has their way.

You get to explain to my wife why I'm
late for dinner, Lieutenant.
Sir, the Joker card had traces of
your D.N.A. on it

Don't do that
all right. Let's be serious, then.
okay.
what's your answer?
I don't have an answer.

How'd they get my D.N.A.?
Somebody with access to your office or
house must've lifted a tissue or a
glass...wait! wait!

well, i guess no answer is a no
harvey
it's someone else, isn't it?
harvey
just tell me it's not wayne
the guy's complete f..
what are you doing?

get a medic!

they've come for him.

we made it 

stay hidden

Good evening. ladies and gentlemen.
We're tonight's entertainment.
I only have one question: where is Harvey Dent?
you know where harvey is?
you know who he is?

hands up, pretty boy

do you know where i can find harvey?
i need to talk to him about something
just something little, huh? no

what's going on out there? wayne!
oh, thank god, you've got a panic room.
hey, wait... oh, you gotta be kidding me.

you know, I'll settle for his loved ones...
We're not intimidated by thugs.
You know, you remind me of my father.
I hated my father.
okay Stop!
well Hello, beautiful. You must be
Harvey's squeeze. hm?
And you are beautiful. oh You look
nervous- is it the scars?
you Wanna know how I got them? 
come here, hey, look at me so I had a wife,
she was beautiful like you. Who tells
me I worry too much. Who tells me I ought
to smile more. Who gambles And
gets in deep with the sharks. hey One
day they carve her face, and we have
no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
I just wanna see her smile again.
I just want her to know that I don't care
about the scars. So I stick a razor in
my mouth and do this to myself...
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me...
She leaves! now I see the funny
side. Now I'm always smiling.
A little fight in you. I like that.
Then you're going to love me.
Drop the gun
oh Sure. you Just take off your little mask and
show us all who you really are...hm?
Let her go.
Very poor choice of words...
Are you alright?
Let's not do that again, is harvey okay?
He's safe.
Thank you.

Jim, it's over.
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.
the prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a
Judge while judges and police
commissioners are getting blown away.
What about Dent?
he's got any sense, Dent's halfway
to Mexico..
So where do you keep your trash?
You're due in court- I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.
You can't protect me- you
can't even protect yourselves.
you Refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here- you go to county. 
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

Targeting me won't get their money
back. I knew the mob wouldn't go
down without a fight, but this is
different. They've crossed a line.
You crossed the line first, sir. You
squeezed them, you hammered them to the
point of desperation. And in
their desperation, they turned to a
man they didn't fully understand.
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
We just need to figure out what he's after.
with respect, Master Wayne, perhaps
this is a man you don't fully
understand, either.
A long time ago. I was in Burma. My
friends and I were working for the
local government. They were trying
to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders,
by bribing them with precious stones.
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a
bandit. so we went looking for the stones.
But in six months, we never met anyone
who traded with him.
One day I saw a child playing with
a ruby the size of a tangerine.
The bandit had been throwing them away.
So why steal them?
Because he thought it was good sport.
Because some men aren't looking for
anything logical, like money... they
can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or
negotiated with.
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

your name, sir?
eighth and orchard.
you'll find harvey dent there.

Check the names.
Richard Dent, Patrick Harvey...
Harvey Dent.
I need ten minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.
Us contaminate it? It's because of
you these guys are dead...
detective!
give us a minute, guys
That's brick underneath
gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
No. Fingerprints.
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast
because we found his next target...
he's put it in tomorrow's paper

i'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir

What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
You wanted me to do the diligence on
the L.S.I.Holdings deal again. 
well, I found some irregularities.
Their CEO is in police custody.
no Not with their numbers. With yours.
applied sciences. whole division of Wayne
enterprises just disappeared, overnight.
I went down to the archives and i started
pulling some old files.
Don't tell me you didn't recognize
your baby out there pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.
now you got the entire R and D
department burning through cash, claiming
it's related to cell phones for the
army. What are you building for him now?
A rocket ship? I want ten million dollars
a year. For the rest of my life.
Let me get this straight. You think
that your client, one of the
wealthiest most powerful men in
the world, is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands..
And your plan is to blackmail
this person? Good luck.
when.. keep that.

this is your original scan...
Here it is reengineered...
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.
I'll get you a copy.
Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?
Yes. Government telecommunications project.
I was no aware we had any
government contracts.
you know, Lucius. I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.
Fair enough.

With no word from the Batman- even as
they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these
cops have to be wondering if the
Joker will make good on his
threat in the obituary column of
the gotham times to kill the Mayor

I've checked all the databases
there are four possibles.
Cross-reference the addresses.
Look for Parkside, overlooking the parade.
i Got one. Melvin White, 1502
Randolph Apartments aggravated
assault, moved to Arkham twice-

what do you got on the roof?
We're tight. But frankly... there's
a lot of windows up here.

commissioner loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement and to the protection
of his community. i remember when i
first took office and i asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner
and he said he would, provided i kept my
politics out of his office
clearly he was not a man who minced words,
nor should he have been.
a number of policies that he enacted as
commissioner were unpopular.
policies that flooded my office with
angry calls and letters...

who's that
what happened?
they took our guns, and our uniforms...

and as we recognize the sacrifice of this man
we must remember that vigilance is the
price of safety

stand by. honor guard
attention. port arms
ready! aim! fire! ready! aim!
stay down! don't move!
mr. mayor get him out of here
i'll see you later
why are you going back?
get out of here
tell me what you know about the joker

no..i'm sorry, barbara
Jimmy, go play with your sister
go ahead honey.
if there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you shh...
Are you out there?! Are you?!
You brought this craziness on us!
You did! You brought this on us

Switch it off- he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us. God
help whoever he does wanna talk to.

Can't we go someplace quieter!
We can't hear each other talk!
what makes you think
I wanna hear you talk.
What?!

yeah? second. okay
Harvey, where are you?!
Where are you?
i'm Where you should be- at Major Crimes
i'm trying to deal with all of this mess.
can i get the fingerprint analysis?
Rachel, listen to me. You're not
safe there.
This is Gordon's unit
Gordon's gone, Rachel.
He vouched for these men
And he's gone. The Joker's named you next.
god, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?
bruce. we can trust bruce wayne
no. rachel, come on i know you're
his friend, but
harvey, trust me.
bruce's penthouse is now the safest
place in the city
then you go straight there
don't tell anybody where you're going. 
and I'll find you there.
I love you.

I want the Joker.
From one professional to another-if
you're trying to scare somebody, pick
a better spot. From this height the
fall wouldn't kill me.
I'm counting on it. -huh!
Where is he?
I don't know where he is. he found us.
He must have friends.
Friends? have You met this guy?
Someone knows where he is.
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing 
they're wise to your act- you got
rules... the Joker, he's got no
rules. Nobody's gonna cross him for
you. if You want this guy, you got one
way. but you already know what that
is. Just take off that mask let
him come find you.
Or you can let a couple more
people get killed while you make up
your mind?

You wanna play games?
how's that feel?
You wouldn't...
I wouldn't. you don't think i will?
Mm-mm. you don't think i will? Mm-mm.
no, no. i wouldn't
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.
Heads- you get to keep your head.
Tails... not so lucky. So, you wanna
tell me about the Joker?
let's Go again.
I don't know anything! god, don't
You're not playing the odds, friend.
let's do it again.
You'd leave a man's life to chance?
Not exactly.
His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a
paranoid schizophrenic, former
patient at Arkham. The kind of mind
the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?
The Joker killed Gordon- 
He's gonna kill Rachel...
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be. 
Your stand against organized crime
is the first legitimate ray of
light in Gotham in decades.
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone- all the
criminals you pulled out the streets
would be released. And Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.
You're gonna hold a press
conference. Tomorrow morning.
Why?
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham's in your hands, now.
You can't! You can't give in!
You can't give in!

Harvey called. He said Batman's gonna
turn himself in.
I have no choice.
You honestly think that's gonna keep
the Joker from killing people?
maybe not. But I have enough
blood on my hands. and I've seen, now,
what I would have to become to stop
men like him.
You once told me that if the day came
when I was finished...
that We'd be together.
Bruce, don't make me your one hope
for a normal life
But did you mean it?
Yes.
bruce, if you turn yourself in they're
not gonna let us be together

logs as well?
everything anything that could
lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
People are dying, Alfred. What would
you have me do?
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
They'll hate you for it, but that's
the point of Batman... he can be the
outcast. He can make the choice that no
one else can make. The right choice.
no, Today I've found out what Batman
can't do. He can't endure this.
Today you get to say 'I told you so'.
Today, I don't want to.
but I did bloody tell you.
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well as Your accomplice.
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for
coming. I've called this press
conference for two reasons. Firstly,
to assure the citizens of Gotham that
everything that can be done over the
Joker killings is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman has
offered to turn himself in.
But first. Let's consider the
situation: should we give in to this
terrorist's demands? Do we really
think that he's gonna...
You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of citizens?!
The Batman is an outlaw...
But that's not why we're demanding he
turn himself in. We're doing it
because we're scared. We've been
happy to let the Batman clean up our
streets for us until now.
Things are worse than ever! -Amen.
Yes. They are. But the night is
darkest just before the dawn.
And I promise you, the dawn is
coming.
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken- but
to us, not to this madman.
NO MORE DEAD COPS!! -yeah
he should turn himself in!
give us the batman! come on!
where is he?
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.
what? -is he here?
I am the Batman.
what?  come on.

Alfred? Why is he letting Harvey do this
He went down to the press conference
i know. And he just stood by?!
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent
believe that Batman stands for
something more important than a
whims of a terrorist, Miss Dawes, even
if everyone hates him for it.
That's the sacrifice he's making. he's
not being a hero. 
he's being something more.
yeah , you're absolutely right.
letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.
You know him better than anyone. 
i do.
will you give this to him for me?
when the time is right.
How will I know?
It's not sealed.
Goodbye, Alfred.
bye, Rachel.

sorry, I didn't have time to talk
this through with you.
what are you doing?
They're transferring me to central
holding. This is the Joker's chance,
and when he attacks, Batman will take
him down.
listen to me This is too dangerous
we get this guy to county,
he's their problem. the streets will be
cleared
so let's go
the convoys stop for no reason
i hope you've got some moves, pal.
He's using you as bait- he doesn't
even know if he can get the Joker
he's failed so far.
How do you know what he's thinking?
I just i do, anyway, Harvey, this isn't
just about you, what about all the
people who are depending on you
to clean the city up and
to do it honorably and... 
harvey. Tell everyone the truth
Heads I go through with it.
This is your life... you can't leave
something like that to chance...
I'm not.
You make your own luck.

hey, You wait like everybody else, pal.
what the hell is that?
obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead
damn it! all units divert down onto
lower fifth. i repeat, exit down, exit down
Lower 5th? We'll be like turkeys
on thanksgiving down there.
jesus. come on, Get us out of here!
let's go
listen, we need backup.
we've got company.
we got trouble, guys.
lock and load!
the hell was that?
these are built for that, right?
he's gonna need something a lot
bigger to get through this
what is that?
what is that, a bazooka?
i didn't sign up for this
look out! look out! hm...
come one let's go!
harvey, harvey, harvey dent.
oh, excuse me. i wanna drive.
scanning all systems.
scanning all systems.

some of their own medicine
that's what i'm talking about.

that's not good.
okay that's not good.
now, there's batman.
ooh, you wanna play. come on. come on.
He missed!
you can't stop here.
we're like sitting ducks!
come on, come on come on. come on.
i want you to do it, i want you to do it
come on. come on come on
i want you to do it,
Hit me. Come on. Hit me.
come on come on aah!
could you please 
Just give me a minute.
We got you, you son of a bitch.
gor... you do like to play things
pretty close to the chest...
We got him, Harvey.
mr. dent! how does it feel
to be the biggest hero in gotham?
no, i'm no here. gotham's finest,
they're the heroes
but you and your office have been
working with the batman all along
no, but i trusted him to do
the right thing
which was?
saving my ass.
all right, people, that's enough.
let him be. let him be.
Thank you, detective- I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.
I figured, counselor.

Stand away! All of you. I don't
want anything for his mob lawyer to
use, you understand? 
Back from the dead.
I uh.. couldn't risk my family's safety.
What do we got?
Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA,
dental. Clothing is custom, no
labels. Nothing in his pockets but
knives and lint. No name, no other alias
Go home, Gordon. The clown'll keep
till morning. go Get some rest- you're
gonna need it. Tomorrow, you take
the big job.
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

i'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety

Look at these ugly bastards.
I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer. You're lucky to
be feeling anything below the neck.
please!
step away from the bars!
my insides hurt

Did Batman save you, daddy?
Actually, this time I saved him.

Has he said anything, yet?
Evening, Commissioner.
Harvey Dent never made it home.
Of course not.
What have you done with him?
Me? I was right here. Who did you
leave him with? hm? Your people?
Assuming, of course, that they are still
your people and not Maroni's...
Does it depress you, commissioner, to
know just how alone you really are?
Does it make you feel responsible for
Harvey Dent's current predicament?
Where is he?
what's the time?
What difference does that make?
well Depending on the time,
he may be in one spot Or several.
If we're gonna play games,
I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
ah, The good cop, bad cop routine?
Not exactly.
Never start with the head... the victim
gets all fuzzy. he Can't feel the next
See?
You wanted me. Here I am.
I wanted to see what you'd do. And
you didn't disappoint...
You let five people die.
Then you let Dent take your place.
Even to a guy like me... that's cold
Where's Dent?
Those mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.
But I know the truth- there's no
going back. You've changed things.
Forever.
Then why do you wanna kill me?
I don't wanna kill you.
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No no
you...
You. Complete. Me.
You're garbage who kills for money.
Don't talk like one of them- you're
not, even if you'd like to be. To
them you're just a freak like me... 
they need you right now.
but when they don't
they'll cast you out like a leper.
you see,  Their morals, their code... 
it's a bad joke.
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
They're only as good as
the world allows them to be.
I'll show you... when the chips
are down, these civilized people...
they'll eat each other.
See, I'm not a monster... I'm just
ahead of the curve.
where's dent?
You have all these rules. And you think
they'll save you.
he's in control
I have one rule.
oh, Then that's the rule you'll have to
break To know the truth.
Which is?
The only sensible way to live in this
world is without rules. Tonight
you're gonna break your one rule...
I'm considering it.
There's only minutes left- so,
you gonna have to play my little game
if you wanna save one of them.
Them?
you know, For a while there
I thought you really were Dent,
the way you threw yourself
after her
Look at you go... does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?
WHERE ARE THEY?!
Killing is making a choice...
WHERE ARE THEY?!
choose between one life or the other.
Your friend, the district attorney.
Or his blushing bride-to-be.
You have nothing. Nothing to
threaten me with. Nothing to do with
all your strength...
But don't worry, I'm gonna tell
you where they are. Both of them,
and that's the point- you'll have to
choose.
He's at 250 fifty second street And
she's on avenue X at Cicero.
Which one you going after?
rachel.
we're getting dent!
250 52nd street

they got me wired to these oli drums.
i am too.

I want my phone call.
i want it. i want it. i want my phone call.
That's nice.
How many of your friends have I killed?
I'm a twenty year man. and I know
the difference between punks who need
a little lesson in manners, and the
freaks like you who would just enjoy it.
And you killed six of my friends.
six?

Please. My insides hurt.
i don't really care. back away.
The boss said he would make the
voices go away. He said he'd go
inside and replace them with bright
lights. Like Christmas.
you're out of your mind, pal. back off
medic right away to the holding tank.
come on. get the door open.
you guys, back off!

do You wanna know why I use a knife,
Guns are too quick. You can't savor
all the little emotions. you See,
in their last moments,
people show you who they really are...
So, in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.
Would you like to know which of them
were cowards?

what's that? -jeez.
he's got some kind of a... contusino.

I know you're gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna have to try and
enjoy it even more.
whoa, whoa!

Hello there.
back at the MCU, the joker's gone.
with Lau?
The Joker planned to be caught. He
wanted me to lock him up in the M.C.U..

Dear Bruce, I need to be honest and clear.
i'm going to marry harvey dent.
i love him, and i wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.
When I told you that if Gotham no
longer needed Batman we could be
together, I meant it...
But now I'm not sure the day won't come...
when you no longer need Batman.
i hope it does, and if it does I will
be there...but as your friend

I'm sorry, harvey.

i'm sorry to let you down...
If you lose your faith in me, please
keep your faith in people...
Love, now and always, Rachel.

prepared a little breakfast.
Very well. then.
Alfred?
Yes, Master Wayne?
Did I bring this on her?
I was meant to inspire good, not
madness, not death.
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the face of Gotham's criminals.
didn't you think there might be
some casualties? Things were always
gonna get worse before they got
better.
But Rachel, Alfred...
Rachel believed in what you stood
for. What we stand for.
Gotham needs you.
no, Gotham needs its true hero
And I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.
Which is why, for now, they're gonna have to
make do with you.
She was gonna wait for me. alfred. Dent
doesn't know. He can never know...
What's that?
It can wait.
That bandit, in the forest in
Burma... Did you catch him?
yes.
How?
We burned the forest down.

he's a credible source- an m and a
lawyer for a prestigious consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right thing...
and Now he's taking matters into his own
hands. We'll be live at five with
the true identity of the Batman

I'm sorry about Rachel.
The Doctor says you're in agonizing
pain but you won't accept medication.
That you're refusing to accept skin grafts
Remember that name you all had for me
when I was at Internal Affairs? What
was it, Gordon?
Harvey, I...
say it, SAY IT!
Two-face. Harvey two-face.
Why should I hide who I am?
I... I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up- was
he working for them?
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
Harvey, I need to know which of my
men I can trust.
Why would you listen to me now?
I'm sorry, Harvey.
No. No you're not. Not yet.

This craziness. it's too much.
You should have thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.
You want him? I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.

not so crazy as you look.
I told you- I'm a man of my word.
Where's the Italian?

all tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.
i want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

please. joker-man, What you do with all
your money.
you see, I'm a guy of simple taste.
I enjoy Dynamite and gunpowder...
and gasoline...
what the...?
ah,ah,ah
And you know the thing that they have in
common? They're cheap.

i wanna know how much are they playing
you to say who batman really is?
this is our chance. i want Lau alive.
the joker, either way.
hey, jim. get a load of this.
let's take the next caller
harvey dent didn't wanna give in
to this maniac.
you think you know better than him?
i think that if we could talk to
dent today, he may feel differently
and we wish him a speedy recovery.
because god knows, we need him now.

You said you were a man of your word.
oh, I am.
I'm only burning my half.
All you care about is money. This
town deserves a better class of
criminal, and I'm gonna give it to
them. Tell your men they work for me now.
This is my city.
They won't work for a freak.
freak.
why don't we cut you up into little
pieces and feed you to your pooches? hm?
and then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message...
Everything. Burns.

who is this?
i had a vision of a world without batman.
the mob ground out a little profit
and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.
and it was so boring
i've had a change of heart
i don't want mr.reese spoiling everything...
but why should i have all the fun?
let's give someone else a chance.
if coleman reese isn't dead in
60 minutes...then i blow up a hospital

i want you to Call in every officer-
tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons- get every available bus down
to a hospital- the priority is Gotham
General- wheel everybody out of that
place right now- you, you and you, you
come with me.
where are we going, sir?
to get reese.

I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.
Looking for?
Hospital admissions.
Will you be wanting the batpod, sir?
In the middle of the day? alfred?
Not very subtle.
The Lamborghini then.
Much more subtle.

excuse me. let me through.
excuse me. okay.
sir, could you help, please?
i'm gonna find a bus for him.

sir? Commissioner! do You really think
an ordinary citizen would try
to kill this man?
sir, commissioner
Get the cars around back!
go. keep rolling, sam

I see O'Brien and Richards...
No immediate family
member admitted to a Gotham hospital.
They're trying to kill me.
Well, maybe Batman can save you.

Davis, I got space, bring him out.
Davis?

I saw Burns and Zachary... 
nothing on them.
and a patrolman I don't know.
okay, so, what now?
what do we do now?
where are we going?
send the information to gordon

get out of here. davis!
ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now.

it's Berg, isn't it?
Commissioner?
You okay, son?

hi. you know...
I don't want there to be any hard
feelings between us, Harvey.
When you and Rachel were being
abducted I was sitting in Gordon's
cage. I didn't rig those charges.
Your men. Your plan.
Do I really look like a guy with a
plan, You know what I am,
I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't
know what to do with one if I caught
it. you know? I just do things.
the mob has plans. the cops have plans.
gordon's got plans.
you know, they're schemers.
Schemers trying to control their little
worlds. I'm not a schemer, I try to show
the schemers how pathetic their
attempts to control things really
are. So when I say... ah. come here.
when i say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal, you
know that I'm telling the truth...

i'm gonna need your weapon. -what?
why? because my wife's in the hospital?
yeah, that'd be why.

It's the schemers that put you where
you are. You were a schemer. You
had plans and Look where that got you.

police are talking every precaution
urging people not to take matters
into their hands.

I just did what I do best- I took your
little plan, and I turned it on itself.
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of
bullets.hm? you know what i noticed?
Nobody panics when things go 'according
to plan'. even if the plan is horrifying.

If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot, or a
truckload of soldiers will be blowing
up, nobody panics. Because it's all
part of the plan. But when I say
that one little old mayor will die,
well, then, everybody loses their minds!
Introduce a little anarchy, upset
the established order and everything
becomes chaos. I'm an agent of
chaos. oh, And you know the thing about
chaos, It's fair.
You live.
You die.
Now we're talking.

Mr.Reese?
that's Mr.Wayne, isn't it?
That was a very brave thing, you did.
Trying to catch the light?
You weren't protecting the van?
Why? Who's in it?
don't you Think I
should go to the hospital?
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr.Wayne?

southeast. it's gotham general.
did you clear the building?
yeah
you must know how many were inside.
you have patient lists, roll call.
right now we're showing
50 people missing. one bus.
all these other buses were heading off to
other hospitals. my guess is
we missed one.
yeah? what's your guess about
where harvey dent is?
keep looking. and keep it to yourself.
anybody asks, we got him out.
get me the mayor's office on the line.
we're gonna need the national guard.

people are still missing, including
GCN's own mike engel.
i'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.
i'm mike engel for gotham tonigh.
what does it take to make you
people wanna join in?
you failed to kill the lawyer.
i've gotta get you off the bench...
and into the game.
come nightfall, this city is mine. -mine
and anyone left here plays by my rules. -rules.

mr. fox? security is showing a break-in
at the r&d department

if you don't wanna be in the game.
get out now.
but the bridge and tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise. ha-ha


Sweet Jesus.
Shouldn't you be out there, you know,
doing something?
It's my day off.
I gotta take a leak, keep an eye out
for me, will ya?
now What? You need someone
to shake it for you?
Hello.
Dent, jesus. I thought you was dead.
Half.
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
It must've been Maroni's men
shut up! are you telling me
that you're gonna protect
the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
I don't know- he never told me.
listen, dent
I swear to God, I didn't know what
they were gonna do to you.
that's Funny, because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you, either.

Beautiful. Isn't it?
Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous.
You've turned every cell phone
in gotham into a microphone...
And a high frequency
generator-receiver.
You took my sonar concept and
applied it to every phone in
the City. With half the city feeding
you sonar, you can image all of
Gotham. This is wrong.
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.
at what cost?
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one
person.
this is too much power for one person.
That's why I gave it to you. Only
you can use it.
Spying on thirty million people
isn't part of my job description.
This is an audio sample.
If he talks within range of any phone
in the city, you can triangulate
his position.
I'll help you this one time...
But consider this my resignation.
As long as this machine is at Wayne
enterprises, I won't be.
when you're finished...type in your name.

My officers are going over every inch
of the tunnels and bridges, but with
the Joker's threat they're not an option.
and Land routes East?
Backed up for hours. Which leaves
the ferries with thirty thousand
ready to board. Plus, I wanna use the
ferries so i can get those prisoners
off the island.
The men you and Dent put away? Those
aren't people I'm worried about.
You should be- Whatever the Joker's
planning, it's a good bet that
Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I wanna get'em out of here.
so where is harvey?
we haven't found him.
oh, jesus.
how long can you keep this quiet?

Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
Going to join your wife?
You love her?
Yes.
you ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?
look, Take it up with the Joker.
He killed your woman. he Made you...
like this...
The Joker's just a mad dog. I want
whoever let him off the leash.
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel? It must've
been someone she trusted.
look, If I tell you, will you let me go?
can't hurt your chances.
It was Ramirez.
But you said
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
you're a Lucky man.
But he's not.
Who?
Your driver.

stand back.
hey, man, that ain't right.
we should be on that boat.
you wanna ride across with them?
be my guest.

sir, they've stopped their engines.
right, get on the radio.
tell them we'll come back and
pick'em up once we dump the scumbags.
liberty, this is spirit. come in.
what the heck was that?

Fox? There's something going on
on the ferries...

get down to the engine room now
hey, buddy, what's happening?
captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. and this.
oh my god.
looks like some kind of detonator.
why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?

Tonight, you're all gonna be part
of a social experiment.
Through the magic of diesel fuel and
ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky high.
liberty, come in, over. it's dead.
Anyone attempts to get off their boat,
you all die...

i'm zeroing in.

each of you has a remote to blow up
the other boat.
His voice is on the ferry, but it's
not the source...west...
i have the joker's location
prewitt building
assemble on the building opposite.

at midnight, i blow you all up.
if, however, one of you presses
the button, i'll let that boat live.
so who's it gonna be?
harvey dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...
or the sweet and innocent civilians?
you choose.
oh, and you might wanna decide quickly
because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

stay back. well, now who are you to
decide? we ought to talk this over,
at least.
we don't all have to die.
those men had their chance.
we are not going to talk about this.
why aren't we talking about it?
they're talking over the same exact thing
on the other baot.
let's put it to a vote. -yes.

hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez
Jim needs you to pack up and put the
kids in the car right away.
But the units outside.
those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them as soon
as possible. I'll call them off for
10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast
But where am i supposed to take them?
25052nd street. Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out. -okay.
She believe you?
it's because She trusts you. 
Just like Rachel did.
I didn't know What...
didn't know what they were gonna do?
You're the second cop to say that to me.
What exactly did you think they
were gonna do?
they got me early on. 
My mother's medical bills
Don't! -i'm sorry.
you Live to fight another day, officer.

we found the missing hospital bus.
then we have a hostage situation.
it's a shooting gallery.
why would he choose a spot with
such big windows?
we have clear shots on five clowns
snipers take'em out, smash the windows,
a team rappels in.
team moves in by the stairwells.
two, three casualties max.
let's do it.
it's not that simple.
with the joker, it never is.
what's simple is...
every second, we don't take him
those people on the ferries
get closer to blowing each other...
that won't happen.
then he'll blow both of them up.

we don't have time for paper ballots.
i want everybody to put their votes
on this piece of paper.
if anyone's got pens, pass it along.
thank you. anybody else?
coming through. anybody else? thank you.
we need to get these votes in quickly.
come on.
what are you waiting for?
push the button!
we're running out of time!

I need five minutes. Alone
No. There's no time. We have clear shots.
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!
I have to save Dent!
Get ready
Two minutes. Then we breach.
Fox. I need picture.

Hello?
jim, we're in trouble.

okay, You got p.o.v. on alpha
omni on beta. looks like clowns
and hostages on two floors.
there's a swat team on the stairwell.
another swat team on the roof.

line's clear.

Barbara, calm down
he has the kids!
Hello, Jim.
Harvey? where's my family?
where my family died.

blue Team. acquire the target.
entry team, set your charge.

fox, the swats are targeting
the wrong people.
the clowns are the hostages.
red team go! red team go!
entry team, blow and go!
don't move.
take the shot.
those swats are coming in hot.
clowns, put down your guns.
drop your weapons!
on the ground, now!
doctors, get down!
clear the line of fire. drop your weap...
freeze! stand down or you will be...
look up.
see those bad guys on the floor above?
they're waiting to ambush the swat team
coming up the elevator.
sixty seconds.

the tally is 140against, 396 for.
so go ahead. do it.
we're still here.
and that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

go,go,go! blue team, cover!
trouble on the floor above.
get down on the ground now!
freeze! stop or we will shoot.
we will shoot you. drop the officer.
release the officer right now.
let him go now! on your knees!
we got him. he's out of the game.
keep your hands in the air!
step away from the edge! halt!
be advised.
clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

an, you made it. i'm so thrilled.
where's the detonator?
go get him.

You don't wanna die. But you don't
know how to take a life. 
Give it to me.
These men will kill you and take it,
anyway.

No one wants to get their hands
dirty. Fine. I'll do it. Those men
on that boat they made their choices.
They chose to murder and steal. 
It doesn't makes any sense for us
to have to die, too.

all the old familiar places.
stand by.
red team, floor secure.
hostages are safe.

Give it to me, you can tell them
I took it by force... give it
to me and I'll do what you should
have did ten minutes ago.

we really should stop this fightin,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.
There won't be any fireworks.
and here we go.
What were you trying to prove? That
deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?
You're alone.
Can't rely on anyone these days.
you gotta do everything yourself.
don't we?
that's okay. i came prepared.
it's a funny world we live in.
speaking of which, you know how i got
these scars?
No. But I know how you get these
oh, you. you Just couldn't let me go,
could you?
this is what happens when an
unstoppable force meets an immovable
object. You truly are incorruptible,
aren't you?
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of self-righteousness...
and I won't kill you
because you're just too much fun.
i think you and i are destined
to do this forever.
You'll be in a padded cell, forever.
Maybe we could share one. 
you know, They'll be doubling up,
the rate this city's
inhabitants are losing their minds...
This city just showed you
that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.
Till their spirit breaks completely.
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent,
and all the heroic things he's done.
You didn't think I'd risk losing the
battle for gotham's soul in a
fist fight with you? no, you need
an ace in the hole. mine's harvey.
What did you do?
I took Gotham's white knight. And I
brought him down to our level. It
wasn't hard- see, madness, as you know...
is like gravity.
All it takes is a little push.

Dent?
This is where they brought her,
Gordon. After your men handed her
over. This is where she died.
I know. I was here. Trying to save her.
But you didn't.
I couldn't.
Yes, you could've.
If you'd listened to me- if you
stood up against corruption instead
of doing your deal with the devil.
I was trying to fight the mob!
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you love most, tell them it's
gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?
well, you're about to know
what that feels like, gordon.
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.
You're not going to hurt my family.
No, just the person you love most.
So is it your wife?
Put the gun down. harvey.
harvey, put down the gun.
Please, Harvey...oh goddamn it.
will you Stop pointing that gun at
my family.
We have a winner.
No! Jim stop him! Don't let him!
Harvey, I'm sorry For everything.
Please don't hurt my son.
You brought your cops?
All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who, or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.
You think I wanna escape from this?
There's no escape from this.
you don't wanna hurt the boy, harvey.
It's not about what I want.
It's about what's fair.
You thought we could be decent men in
an indecent time. but you were wrong.
The world is cruel.
And the only morality in a cruel
world is chance. Unbiased.
Unprejudiced. Fair.
His son's got the same chance she had.
Fifty-fifty.
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act. We
three.
Then why was it me who was the
only one who lost everything?
It wasn't.
The Joker chose me!
Because you were the best of us. He
wanted to prove that even someone as
good as you could fall.
And he was right.
You're the one pointing the gun,
Harvey. So point it at the people
responsible.
Fair enough.
You first.
My turn.
Harvey, You're right Rachel's death
was my fault. 
please don't punish the boy.
please, punish me.
I'm about to. Tell your boy he's
gonna be all right, Gordon. Lie.
Like I lied.
It's going to be all right, son.
Dad, daddy, is he okay?
Thank-you.
You don't have to thank me.
Yes, I do.
The Joker won.
Harvey's prosecution, everything he
fought for Undone.
whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city... dies with Harvey's
reputation. We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best of us and
tore him down. People will lose hope.
They won't.
They must never know what he did.
Five dead? Two of them cops? you
can't sweep that...
No. But the Joker cannot win.
Gotham needs its true hero.
no.
You either die a hero or you live long
enough to see yourself become the
villain. I can do those things
because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.
No, no, you can't! You're not!
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
call it in.

...a hero. Not the hero we deserved
but the hero we needed. Nothing less
than a knight. Shining...
They'll hunt you.
You'll hunt me.
You'll condemn me, set the dogs on me...
because that's what needs to happen.
Because sometimes truth isn't
good enough...
sometimes, people deserve more.
sometimes people deserve to have their
faith rewarded.

Batman?!
Why's he running, Dad?!
Because we have to chase him...
okay we're going in! go, go! move!
He didn't do anything wrong!
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves...
but not the one it needs right now.
So we'll hunt him, because he can
take it. Because he's not a hero...
he's a silent guardian, 
a watchful protector...
a dark knight.
