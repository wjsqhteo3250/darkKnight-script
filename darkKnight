Three of a kind. Let's do this.

That's it? Three guys?

two guys on the roof. Every guy
gets a share Five shares is
plenty.

Six shares. Don't forget the guy who
planned the job.

He thinks he can sit it out 
and still take a slice i know why
they call him the Joker.

so Why do they call him the Joker?

I heard he wears make-up.

Make-up?

Yeah. To scare people. you know War paint.

all right, everybody, hands up, heads down!
i said, hands up heads down!
let's go pal, i'm making a withdrawal here.
i said hands up -no

Here comes the silent alarm.

And there it goes. 
heads down! all right, tootsie, 
you're taking a dive with me.
down i said stay down there
don't hurt me

That's funny. It didn't dial out to 911- it was
trying to reach a private number.
Is it a problem?

No, I'm done here.

sit down down
down i said stay down there
Obviously, we don't want you doing
anything with your hands other than
holding on for dear life.

on the ground stay on the ground
nobody make a move nobody stay down

yeah! you have any idea who you're stealing from?
you and your friends are dead.
he's out, right?

Where did you learn to count?!
 

They wired this thing up with 5,000
volts. What kind of bank does that?

A mob bank. i Guess the Joker's as
crazy as they say.

Where's the alarm guy?

Boss told me when the guy was done I
should take him out. One less share. right?

Funny, he told me something
similar...
he what? no! no!

that's a lot to carry...

If this joker guy was so smart he would
have had us bring a bigger car.

I'm betting the Joker told you to
kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
 
no no No. I kill the bus driver.

Bus driver? What bus driver? 

school's out time to go
that guy's not getting up is he?
that's a lot of money
what happened to the rest of guys?

you Think you're smart, huh? the
guy that hired youse he'll just do the same
to you...

oh, Criminals in this town
used to believe in things...
Honor. Respect. look at you. What do you
believe in, huh? What do you believe in?

I believe that what doesn't kill
you...
...simply makes you stranger.

Mr Mayor, you were elected in a
campaign to clean up the city... when
are you going to start?

oh my god, i believe i already have

Like this so-called Batman- we're hearing
he's doing some good,
that criminals are running scared...
but I say NO. 

No, man. I don't like it tonight.

What're you, superstitious? You got
more chance of winning the powerball
than running into him...

that's simply just not true
i'm told that our men in the major cirmes unit are close
to an arrset

Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
closing in on the Batman.

The investigation is ongoing.

the process of cleaning up the streets is a long one
i pledged in my campaign, uh to have

Ever intending to see your wife
again, Lieutenant?

I thought you had to go look after
your mother, detective.
checked her back into hospital.
I'm sorry.
so He hasn't shown up?
Often doesn't. But I like reminding
everybody that he's out there.
Why wouldn't he come?
Hopefully... Because he's busy.

That's why we bring dogs.
My little princes...
please they're crawling in my mouth
please i beg you get them off
look what your drugs do to my customers.
Buyer beware...
I told your man my compound would
take you places. I never said they'd
be places you wanted to go.
My business , repeat customers.
you don't like what I have to
offer, buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left anyone to
buy from.
my dogs are hungry, pity there's only one of you...
what? -that's not him
Loose the dogs!
that's more like it

don't let me find you out here again
We're trying to help you!
I don't need help.
Not my diagnosis.
What gives you the right?! What's
the difference between you and me?!
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

everybody back now!
He can't resist showing us his face.
What's he hiding under that makeup?
can we get a minute people please?
Him again. Who are the others?
Another bunch of smalltimers.

Some of the marked bills I gave you.

My detectives have been making drug
buys with them for weeks. This bank
was another drop for the mob. That
makes five we found the
bulk of their dirty cash.

Time to move in.

We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
What about this Joker guy?

One man or the entire mob? He can wait.

When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

Do you trust him?

Be hard to keep him out.

I hear he's as stubborn as you.

Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
and you can swap not sleeping in a
penthouse for not sleeping in a
mansion.
When you stitch yourself up you do make
a bloody mess.

yeah it makes me learn from my mistakes.

You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.

My armor... I'm carrying too much
weight- I need to be faster.

I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.

Did you get mauled by a tiger?

it was a dog. -huh?

it was A big dog. There were more copycats
last night, Alfred. With guns.

why don't you hire them take the weekend off.

that wasn't exactly what I had in
mind when I said I wanted to inspire people.

I know. But things have improved
Look at the new District Attorney...

I am. Closely. need to know if he can be trusted.

Are you interested in his character... or his social circle?

Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.

I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.

If you ever took one, I might.

Know your limits, Master Wayne.

Batman has no limits.

Well, you do, sir.

well can't afford to know them.

And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?

We all know how much you like to say
'I told you so'.

on That day, Master Wayne, even I won't 
want to. Probably.

Sorry I'm late, folks.

Where were you?

Worried you'd have to step up?

harvey, I know these briefs backwards.

Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
take it. Tails, he's all yours.

yeah? You wanna flip a coin to see who leads?

it's My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

i wouldn't leave something like that up to chance

I don't. I make my own luck.

all rise. the honorable judge freel presiding 

I thought the DA just played golf
with the Mayor, things like that.

Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.

With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
someone must've stepped up to run the
so-called family.

Is that man in the courtroom today?

Could you identify him for us, please?

You win, counselor. It was me.

I've a sworn statement from you
that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
the new head of the Falcone crime
family.

Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
brains of the organization.

order.

Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

Hostile? I'll show you hostile.

carbon fiber 28 caliber. Made in China.
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.

get him out of here.

But, your honor, I'm not done...

We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni,
so we won't be able to charge him, but the fact they're trying to kill you means we're getting to them.

i'm Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm
fine by the way.

come on Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.
you're not getting shot at, you're
not doing your job right.

but you know if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day off...

Can't. I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.

oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually try to be nice.

i hear you got a hell of a right cross. 
it's a Shame Sal's going to walk.

yeah, Well, good thing about the mob is
they keep giving you second chances.

Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

We liaise with various agencies

Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.

what about that floodlight on top of M.C.U.?

If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment... 
i suggest you take them up with maintenance, counselor.

I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars. But the mob
is still getting its money out. I
think you and your "friend" have
found the last game in town and
you're trying to hit 'em where it
hurts: their wallets. it's Bold. You
gonna count me in?

In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

Gordon, I don't like that you've got
your own special unit, and I don't
like that it's full of cops I
investigated at internal affairs.

If I didn't work with cops you'd
investigated while you were making
your name at I.A.- I'd be working
alone. I don't get political points
for being an idealist- I have to do
the best I can with what I have.

You want me to back warrants for
search and seizure on five banks
without telling me what we're after?

I can give you the names of the
banks.

Well, that's a start. I'll get you
your warrants. But I want your
trust.

You don't have to sell me, Dent. We
all know you're Gotham's white knight.

yeah well, I hear they have a different
name for me down at M.C.U..

i wouldn't know about that

In China Lau security investments stands for
dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese
venture with Wayne Enterprises will
be a powerhouse.

Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
expressing our own excitement...

Sir, I know that Mr.Wayne is curious about how
his trust fund gets replenished but
frankly... this is embarrassing.

You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

It's done- the numbers are solid.

Do them again. Wouldn't want the trust
fund to run out, now would we?

Another long night?

This joint venture was your idea, and
the consultants love it, but I'm not
convinced. Lau's company has grown by 8 percent
annually, like clockwork. his revenue stream must be
off the books. Maybe even illegal.

OK. Cancel the deal.

You already knew.

just needed a closer look at their books.

Anything else you can trouble me for?

I need a new suit.

Three buttons is a little nineties. mr.wayne.

I'm not talking the fashion,
Mr.Fox, so much as function.

You wanna be able to turn your head?

Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.

I'll see what I can do.

took three weeks to get a
reservation here and I had to tell them I
work for the government.

Really?

This city health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

Rachel! Fancy that.

Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.

Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

natasha are you the prima..?

prima ballerina for the moscow ballet

wow harvey's taking me next week.

really so you're into ballet?

Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

the famous bruce wayne rachel's told me everything
about you

i certainly hope not

so let's put a couple tables together.

I'm not sure that they'll let us

oh They should! I own the place.

how could you want to
raise children in a city like this?

well I was raised here. I turned out OK.

Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
our new D.A. you might wanna figure
out where your jurisdiction ends.

I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante...

Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
officials, not a man who thinks he's
above the law.

Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?

We did. All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city.

But this is a democracy, Harvey.

When their enemies were at the gates,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the
city. It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered public service.

harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar. 
He never gave up his power.

okay fine you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain. Look,
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life
How could he? Batman's looking for someone to take
up his mantle.

Someone like you, Mr.Dent?

Maybe. If I'm up to it.

what if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader?

If I were sneaking out every night
someone would've noticed by now.

Well, i'm sold me, Dent. 
I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
not up for reelection for three years. 

no you don't understand. One
fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
need another cent.

what The hell is this...?

As you're all aware, one of our deposits was
stolen. A relatively small amount: 68 million.

Who's stupid enough steal from us?

Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
purple suit and make-up. He's not
the problem- he's a nobody.

The problem is our money being
tracked by the cops.

Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
sources we know that police have
indeed identified our banks using
marked bills and are planning to
seize your funds today And since the
enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
competitors out of business, I'm your
only option.

So what do you propose?

Moving all deposits to one secure
location. Not a bank.

Where, then?

no one can know but me.

If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you everyone's money
would be at stake.

What stops them getting to you?

I go to HongKong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

how soon can you move the money

i already have

for obvious reasens, i couldn't wait for you permission
rest assured, your money is safe
 
and I thought my jokes were bad.

Give me one reason why I shouldn't have
my boy here pull your head off.

How about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
ta-da! it's gone
oh And by the way, the suit it wasn't
cheap. You ought to know. You bought it.

Sit. I want to hear proposition.

let's wind the clocks back a year
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you. i mean, What happened? Did your balls drop off? hm?
you See, a guy like me

A freak.

A guy like me... look listen. I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem.. group therapy
session in broad daylight. I know
why you're afraid to go out at night.
the Batman. see batman has shown Gotham your true
colors. unfortunately Dent, he's just the beginning.
And as for the television's so-called plan- Batman
has no jurisdiction. He'll find him
and make him squeal.
I know the squealers when i see them and..

What do you propose?

It's simple. we, uh, Kill the Batman.

If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?

if you're good at something, never do it for free.

How much you want?

Half.

you're crazy.

no i'm not

if we don't deal with this now, soon little
Gambol here won't be able to get a
nickel for his grandma

Enough from the clown.

Let's not blow this out of proportion.

You think you can steal from us and
just walk away? 

yeah

I'm putting the word out- 5 hundred grand for this clown
dead. A million alive, so I can
teach him some manners, first.

all right. so listen why don't you give me a call
when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously
here's my card

You're a hard man to reach.
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
asked, I could have taken his passport- 
I told you to keep me in the loop.

All that was left in the vaults were the marked bills- 
they knew we were coming! As soon as your
office got involved,

My office?! You're sitting down there
with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..
Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your
rookie cold on a racketeering beef.

Don't try to cloud the fact that
clearly Maroni's got people in your
office, Dent.

We need Lau back, but the Chinese
won't extradite a national under any
circumstances.

If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?

I'll get him to sing.

We're going after the mob's life
savings. Things will get ugly.
 
I knew the risks when I took this
job, lieutenant. How will you get him back, anyway?

He does that.

Our Chinese friends left town before I
could tell them the deal was off.

I'm sure that you've always wanted to go
to Hong Kong.

What's wrong with a phone call?

I think Mr.Lau deserves a more personal touch.

now For high altitude jumps, you're gonna need
oxygen and stabilizers. well I must say, compared to your usual requests, jumping out of an airplane is pretty
straightforward.

what about getting back into the plane?
 
I'd recommend a good travel agent.

Without it landing.

now That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.

The CIA had a program in the '60s for
getting their people out of hot spots Called Sky Hook. 
we could look into that

yeah

okey now

Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped tri-weave  fibers for flexibility...
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile...
Perhaps you should read the instructions, first.

yeah

Now, there is a trade-off...
separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable
to knives and gunfire

We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?
How will it hold up against dogs?

you talking rotweilers or chihuahuas?
should do fine against cats.

I found one. In Arizona. Very nice
man said he could have it up and running in a week,
And he takes cash. What about a flight crew?
 
South Korean smugglers. They run
flights into Pyongyang, below radar
the whole way. Did you think of an alibi?

Oh, yes.
EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT

I believe this is your plane sir

You look tired, Alfred. you'll be all right without me?

If you can tell me the Russian for
'apply your own bloody suntan lotion.’

yo gambol, Somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.
they brought the body.

So. Dead that's five hundredBehind 

How about alive?
you Wanna know how I got these scars? My
father was a drinker and a fiend. and one night,
he goes off crazier than usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not. One. Bit.
So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, 
laughing while he does it.
he Turns to me and he says 'why so
serious?' he Comes at me with the knife-
'why so serious?' Sticks the blade in my mouth- 
'Let's put a smile on that face' and...
Why so serious?
Now, our operation is small, but
there is a lot of potential for
aggressive expansion... so which of
you fine gentlemen would like to join
our team? oh there's Only one spot right now-
so we're gonna have try-outs. Make it fast.

Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox! Mr.Lau
regrets he is unable to greet you in
person today. 

I understand!

for security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to
check in your mobile.

of course.

I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding with the Gotham
police force... I couldn't let such
a thing threaten my company. 

of course 

A businessman of your stature will
understand and.. with you here... now we can continue.

Well, i do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr.Lau. But

We do not allow cell phones in here

Sorry. Forgot I had it. no, i really
come to tell you that our business deal has to be put
on hold. you see, we can't afford to be seen to do
business with...whatever it is you're accused of being.
i'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.

I think, Mr.Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.

Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think that he was
deliberately wasting your time.

Just accidentally wasting it.

That's very good-mr lau "accidentally".
Very good. 

There's a better view from the peak tram.

How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?

Restricted. Lau is holed up in there
good and tight. 

What's this?

I had R and D work it up- it sends
out a high frequency pulse records the
response time for mapping an environment.

Sonar. Just like a..

Submarine. mr. wayne Like a submarine.

And the other device?

it's In place. Mr.Wayne? Good luck.
--------------------------------------------------

Give us the money and we'll deal.
LAU
The money is the only reason I'm
still alive.
Rachel leans forward, speaking softly. Clearly.
RACHEL
You mean when they hear that you've
helped us they're going to kill you?
EVANS
Are you threatening my client?
RACHEL
No, I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.
As will everyone.
(moves to the door)
Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.
LAU
Wait.
(Rachel stops)
I won't give you the money, but I'll
give you my clients. All of them.
RACHEL
You were a glorified accountant- what
could you have on all of them that we
could charge?
LAU
I'm good with calculation- I handled
all their investments. One big pot.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Dent hits a buzzer. Turns to Gordon.
DENT
I've got it. RICO. If their money
was pooled we can charge all of them
as one criminal conspiracy.
GORDON
Charge them with what?
Rachel enters.
40.
DENT
In a RICO case if we can charge any
of the conspirators with a felonyRACHEL
We can charge all of them with it.
Dent nods at Rachel, excited.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Rachel comes back in.
RACHEL
Mr.Lau, do you have details of this
communal fund? Ledgers,
notebooks...?
LAU
(smiles)
Immunity, protection and a chartered
plane back to Hong Kong.
RACHEL
Once you've testified in open court.
So with your clients locked up, what
happens to all that money?
LAU
Like I said- I'm good with
calculation.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Dent and Gordon watch Lau.
GORDON
He can't go to County. I'll keep him
here in the holding cells.
DENT
What is this Gordon, your fortress?
GORDON
You trust them over at County?
DENT
I don't trust them here.
GORDON
Lau stays.
DENT
It's your call, Lieutenant. Be
right.
GORDON
I am, counselor.
41.
EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY
Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.
REPORTER
The Chinese government claim their
international rights have been
broken.
DENT
I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements...
INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS
Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.
DENT
(grins)
...but I'm sure glad he's back.
Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.
CHECHEN
I put word out. We hire the clown.
(off look)
He was right. We have to fix real
problem. Batman.
Maroni shakes his head. Spots Gordon walking over dangling a
pair of handcuffs. Nods at the TV.
GORDON
Our boy looks good on the tube.
MARONI
You sure you want to embarrass me in
front of my friends, Lieutenant?
GORDON
Don't worry, they're coming, too.
Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.
EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY
Prison buses in every neighborhood. COPS load them with
CRIMINALS. Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.
INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY
JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.
JUDGE SURRILLO
...849 counts racketeering, 246
counts fraud, 87 counts conspiracy
murder...
42.
Judge Surrillo turns the page. A PLAYING CARD sits there. A
Joker. He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side.
JUDGE SURRILLO
...how do the defendants plead?
An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE. The
STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.
INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent
enters.
MAYOR
DENT! What was that circus?!
DENT
I asked Gordon to make some arrests.
LOEB
(looks at report)
Five hundred andGORDON
Forty-nine, sir.
Gordon nods at Dent, approving. Dent grins back.
MAYOR
549 criminals at once?! How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
DENT
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.
MAYOR
Even if you blow enough smoke to get
convictions out of Surrillo, you'll
set a new record at appeals for
quickest kick in the ass.
DENT
It won't matter. The head guys make
bail, sure... but the mid-level guys,
they can't, and they can't afford to
be off the streets long enough for
trial and appeal. They'll cut deals
that include some jail time. Think
of all you could do with 18 months of
clean streets.
The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.
MAYOR
The public likes you, Dent. That's
the only reason this might fly.
43.
(MORE)
But that means it's on you. They're
all coming after you, now. Not just
the mob... politicians, journalists,
cops- anyone whose wallet's about to
get lighter. Are you up to it?
(Dent smiles)
You better be. They get anything on
you... those criminals will be back
on the streets...
The Mayor turns to look out of the window. Quiet.
MAYOR
Followed swiftly by you and meBANG! A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's
nose. Dent rushes to the window, looks out...
EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five
stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...
BATMAN. HANGING BY HIS NECK. DEAD. His mouth roughly
painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.
EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
"Batman" is lowered from the flagpole. The same fake Batman
we saw earlier. Pinned to his chest by a KNIFE, a PLAYING
CARD. A Joker. Gordon moves closer to the body. The card
has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN PLEASE STAND UP?
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Wayne comes into the living room, excited. Alfred is
supervising party arrangements.
WAYNE
How's it going?
ALFRED
I think your fundraiser will be a
great success, sir.
WAYNE
And why do you think I wanted to hold
a party for Harvey Dent?
ALFRED
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socialising beyond myself and the
scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try
and impress Miss Dawes.
WAYNE
Very droll. But very wrong.
Actually it's Dent. You see44.
MAYOR (cont'd)
Wayne trails off as he spots something on the television: the
Batman HANGING as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a graphic
that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'. Image cuts to Engel in the
studio.
ENGEL
...Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers be aware: it is
disturbing.
The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift
Batman costume- face bruised and bloody. In some kind of
bright, fluorescent-lit room.
VOICE
Tell them your name.
MAN
(weak)
Brian Douglas.
VOICE
Are you the real Batman?
MAN
No.
VOICE
Why do you dress up like him?
MAN
He's a symbol... that we don't have
to be afraid of scum like you...
VOICE
But you do, Brian. You really do.
You think the Batman's helped Gotham?
Brian nods uncertainly...
VOICE
Look at me.
(Brian looks down)
LOOK AT ME!
Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker,
in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.
THE JOKER
This is how crazy Batman's made
Gotham. You want order in Gotham?
Batman has to go. So...
(leans in)

Wayne turns to Alfred. Silent.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Dent and Rachel get off the lift. Dent stands in awe of the
penthouse and its guests.
RACHEL
Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld, scared
stiff by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel spots someone and darts offDENT
RachelALFRED
A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?
Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.
DENT
Thanks. Alfred, right?
ALFRED
Yes, sir.
DENT
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life?
ALFRED
Not yet, sir.
DENT
(smiles, surveys crowd)
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should
be aware of?
ALFRED
Oh, you have no idea.
Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled. The crowd REACTS
as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks outEXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne's CHOPPER touches down. He spills out with a clutch of
SUPERMODELS...

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevatorWAYNE
Sorry, I'm late- glad you started
without me! Where's Rachel?!
Rachel cringes slightly. Wayne spots her.
WAYNE
Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend. When
she told me she was dating Harvey
Dent, I had one thing to say... the
guy from those god-awful campaign
commercials?
Laughter. Dent shifts, embarrassed.
WAYNE
'I Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice
slogan, Harvey. Certainly caught
Rachel's attention. But then I
started paying attention to Harvey,
and all he's been doing as our new
D.A., and you know what? I believe
in Harvey Dent. On his watch, Gotham
can feel a little safer. A little
more optimistic. So get out your
checkbooks and let's make sure that
he stays right where all of Gotham
wants him...
(raises his glass)
All except Gotham's criminals, of
course. To the face of Gotham's
bright future- Harvey Dent.
Dent smiles accepting the toast.
INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING
Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.
RAMIREZ
That Joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..
GORDON
Any matches?
RAMIREZ
All three.
Gordon STOPS. Turns to face her.
RAMIREZ
The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
47.
GORDON
The Joker's telling us who he's
targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's
house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get
them both into protective custody.
Where's the Commissioner?
RAMIREZ
City hall.
GORDON
Seal the building. No one in or out
till I get there.
EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over
Gotham. Hears someone behind him- Rachel.
RACHEL
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you're making fun
of him. But I do.
WAYNE
(shakes his head)
I meant every word.
Wayne moves closer to Rachel. Takes her arm.
WAYNE
The day you once told me about, the
day when Gotham no longer needs
Batman. It's coming.
Rachel looks at Wayne. Conflicted. He moves closer.
RACHEL
You can't ask me to wait for that.
Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.
WAYNE
It's happening now- Harvey is that
hero. He locked up half the city's
criminals, and he did it without
wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero
with a face.
DENT
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll
give you that. Thanks again. Mind
if I borrow Rachel?
Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent. Wayne
watches them head inside.

Gordon, what are you playing at?
Gordon checks the window. Turns to his men.
GORDON
We're secure. I want a floor-byfloor search of the entire building.
(turns to Loeb)
I'm sorry, sir. We believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.
LOEB
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover
this for yourself, so take my wordthe Police Commissioner earns a lot
of threats...
Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.
LOEB
I found the appropriate response to
these situations a long time ago...
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING
The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.
SURRILLO
Gordon wants me to go right now?
MAN 1
These are dangerous people, Judge.
Even we don't know where you're
going.
He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope. Opens the car door.
MAN 2
Get in, then open the envelope.
It'll tell you where you're headed.
Surrillo climbs in. Watches them drive away. She opens the
envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper. One word on it:
49.
'UP'.
Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a
FIREBALL.
A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground. After a moment, BURNING

Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.
LOEB

STEPHENS
Just the normal number of bad guys in
the building- and they're all city
employees. Here's a list.
LOEB
How'd they get my D.N.A.?
Gordon looks at Stephens's list.
GORDON
Somebody with access to your house or
office must've lifted a tissue or a
glass...
Gordon, realizing, spins aroundGORDON

Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.
DENT
You cannot leave me on my own with
these people.

RACHEL
The whole mob's after you and you're
worried about these guys?
DENT
Compared to this, the mob doesn't
scare me. Although, I will say: them
gunning for you makes you see things
clearly.
RACHEL
Oh, yeah?
DENT
Yeah. It makes you think about what
you couldn't stand losing. And who
you want to spend the rest of your
life with...
Rachel looks at Dent. Smiles.
RACHEL
The rest of your life, huh? That's a
pretty big commitment.
DENT
Not if the mob has their way.
RACHEL
Don't.
DENT
Okay. Let's be serious. What's your
answer?
Rachel looks at him.
RACHEL
I don't have an answer.

The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.
INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.
THUG
Hands up, pretty boy.
Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it as
a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw with
the stock without breaking step, field stripping the shotgun
and tossing the pieces in different directions.
52.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker moves through the terrified guests. Smiling.
THE JOKER
I only have one question: where is
Harvey Dent?
(silence)
I'll settle for his loved ones...
A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.
GENTLEMAN
We're not intimidated by thugs.
The Joker stops. Stares at the man. SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.
THE JOKER
You know, you remind me of my father.
(GRABS him)
I hated my father.
The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.
RACHEL
Stop!
The Joker drops the Gentleman. Turns to Rachel.
THE JOKER
Hello, beautiful. You must be
Harvey's squeeze.
(runs his knife across her
cheek)
And you are beautiful. You look
nervous- it's the scars isn't it?
Wanna know how I got them? I had a
wife, beautiful like you. Who tells
me I worry too much. Who says I need
to smile more. Who gambles. And
gets in deep with the sharks. One
day they carve her face, and we've
got no money for surgeries. She
can't take it.
(presses knife into her
cheek)
I just want to see her smile again.
I just want her to know I don't care
about the scars. So I put a razor in
my mouth and do this to myself...
And you know what?
(starts laughing)
She can't stand the sight of me...
(or crying)
She leaves! See, now I see the funny
side. Now I'm always smiling.
53.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Wayne walks in. A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves back
together, alerted by the noise.
MALE GUEST
What's going on out there, Wayne?
Wayne doesn't answer. He walks into a closet and pulls at a
FALSE WALL. Wayne steps into the safe room.
FEMALE GUEST

As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.
STEPHENS
But the prosecution's over.
STEPHENS
No-one's standing up in front of a
Judge while judges and police
commissioners are getting blown away.
GORDON
What about Dent?
STEPHENS
If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway

The door BURSTS OPEN. Dent. Fire in his eyes.
DENT
So where do you keep your trash?
Gordon looks at Dent. Impressed.
INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.
DENT
You're due in court- I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.
LAU
No way. You can't protect me- you
can't even protect yourselves.
Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.
DENT
Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you
won't be coming back here- you'll go
to county. How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's
video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS.
Wayne turns to Alfred. Indicates the screens.
WAYNE
Targeting me won't get their money
back. I knew the mob wouldn't go
down without a fight, but this is
different. They've crossed a line.
56.
ALFRED
You crossed it first, sir. You've
hammered them, squeezed them to the
point of desperation. And now, in
their desperation they've turned to a
man they don't fully understand.
Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.
WAYNE
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
We just have to figure out what he's
after.
ALFRED
Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps
this is a man you don't fully
understand, either.
ALFRED
(looks at Wayne)
I was in Burma. A long time ago. My
friends and I were working for the
local government. They were trying
to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders,
bribing them with precious stones.
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a
bandit. We were asked to take care
of the problem, so we started
looking for the stones. But after
six months, we couldn't find anyone
who had traded with him.
WAYNE
What were you missing?
ALFRED
One day I found a child playing with
a ruby as big as a tangerine.
(shrugs)
The bandit had been throwing the
stones away.
WAYNE
So why was he stealing them?
ALFRED
Because he thought it was good sport.
Because some men aren't looking for
anything logical, like money... they
can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or
negotiated with.
(grave)
Some men just want to watch the world
burn.
Wayne stares at Alfred. Reaches for the bat-suit.
57.
EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN
MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out
over the ether. CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a

TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table. They each have a

you that these guys are dead in the
first placeGORDON
Ramirez.
She stands down. Batman moves past the bodies to the wall.
Finds an embedded stray bullet. He pulls a SAWING DEVICE
from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting
around the bullet.
GORDON
That's brick- you're gonna try and
take ballistics off a shattered
bullet?
58.
BATMAN
No. Fingerprints.
Ramirez looks at Gordon. Is he serious? Gordon pointsGORDON
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast,

Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".

Fox is at his desk. Reese enters.
FOX
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
REESE
You asked me to do the diligence on
the L.S.I.Holdings deal again. I
found irregularities.
FOX
Their CEO is in police custody.
REESE
Not with their numbers. With yours.
A whole division of Wayne Industries
disappeared, overnight. So I went
down to the archives and started
pulling old files.
He pulls out a folded blueprint. Slides it across the desk.
REESE
My kids love the Batman. I thought
he was pretty cool, too. Out there,
kicking some ass.
Fox picks up the piece of paper. Unfolds it. It's an old
BLUEPRINT. The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.
REESE
Changes things when you know it's
just a rich kid playing dress up.
Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.
REESE
Your project. Don't tell me you
didn't recognize your baby pancaking
cop cars on the evening news. Now
you're getting sloppy. Applied

But now you've got the entire R and D
department burning cash, claiming
it's related to cell phones for the
army. What are you building him now?
A rocket ship? I want ten million a
year. For the rest of my life.
Fox looks at him. Even. Folds up the blueprint.
FOX
Let me get this straight. You think
that your client, one of the
wealthiest and most powerful men in
the world, is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare
hands...
(deadpan)
And now your plan is to blackmail
this person?
Reese stares at Fox. Who smiles. And slides the blueprint
across the desk.
FOX
Good luck.
Reese looks at it. Then at Fox. Swallows. Slides it back.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne hands Alfred a RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID. He
slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER
CONTROLLED GATTLING GUN. He puts on ear protectors. Hits a
button.
The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS
into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.
ALFRED
I'm not sure you made it loud enough,
sir.
As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying the
sample from the crime scene. Comparing its spread to the new
samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY SCANNER.
The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D
IMAGES of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY
The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen. Fox hits

Fox looks at the screen, impressed. Thinks.

Exasperated. Looks back up at the Joker's Thug. Spots
something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...

Someone knows where he is.
Maroni looks up at Batman. Sneering.
MARONI
No one's gonna tell you anythingthey're wise to your act- you got
rules... the Joker, he's got no
rules. No one's gonna cross him for
you. You want this guy, you got one
way. And you already know what that
is. Just take off that mask and let
him come find you.
Batman DROPS Maroni.
MARONI
Or you want to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up
your mind?
INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT
Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN. Bullets. Loads the gun.
SHOVES it in his faceDENT
You wanna play games?
Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE.
Pulls it away and FIRES. The Thug FLINCHES. Dent puts the
gun barrel against the thug's templeJOKER'S THUG
(rattled)
You wouldn't...
And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.
DENT
No. I wouldn't. That's why I'm not
going to leave it up to me.
(shows him coin)
Heads- you get to keep your head.
Tails... not so lucky. So, you want
to tell me about the Joker?
The Thug, scared, says nothing. Dent FLICKS the coin into
the air. SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming with
wrist horizontal). Dent shows him the coin. Heads. The
Thug exhales, SHAKING.
67.
DENT
Go again?
JOKER'S THUG
(sobbing)
I don't know anything!
DENT
You're not playing the odds, friend.
Dent tosses the coin again. This time IT DOESN'T LAND. Dent
looks up. Batman is there.
BATMAN
You'd leave a man's life to chance?
DENT
Not exactly.
BATMAN
His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a
paranoid schizophrenic, a former
patient at Arkham. The kind of mind
the Joker attracts.
Batman moves away from Schiff.
BATMAN
What do expect to learn from him?
Dent is shivering with frustration.
DENT
The Joker killed Gordon- and, and
Loeb. He's going to kill Rachel...
BATMAN
You're the symbol of hope that I
could never be. Your stand against
organized crime is the first
legitimate ray of light in Gotham for
decades. If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone- all the
criminals you got off the streets
would be released. And Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.
Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.
BATMAN
You're going to call a press
conference. Tomorrow morning.
DENT
Why?
68.
BATMAN
No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands, now.
DENT
You can't! You can't give in!
But Batman is gone.
INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel watches Gotham through the window. Wayne enters.
RACHEL
Harvey called. He says Batman is
going to turn himself in.
WAYNE
I have no choice.
RACHEL
You honestly think it's going to stop
the Joker from killing?
WAYNE
Perhaps not. But I've got enough
blood on my hands. I've seen, now,
what I would have to become to stop
men like him.
Rachel looks at Wayne. She cannot help him.
WAYNE
You once told me that if the day came
when I was finished...
Wayne moves towards her.
WAYNE
We'd be together.
RACHEL
Bruce, don't make me your one hope
for a normal lifeWayne takes her in his arms.
WAYNE
But did you mean it?
RACHEL
Yes.
They kiss. Then separate. She looks sadly into his eyes.
RACHEL
But they won't let us be together
after you turn yourself in.
69.
Wayne nods. Leaves. She watches him go.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN
Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints,
designs, files. He pauses, looking down at a book.
ALFRED
Even the logs?
WAYNE
Anything that could lead back to
Lucius or Rachel.
Alfred tosses the book onto the fire. STARES at Wayne.
WAYNE
People are dying, Alfred. What would
you have me do?
Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.
ALFRED
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
They'll hate you for it, but that's
the point of Batman... he can be the
outcast. He can make the choice no
one else can face. The right choice.
Wayne shakes his head.
WAYNE
Today I've found out what Batman
can't do. He can't endure this.
(rueful smile)
Today you get to say 'I told you so'.
ALFRED
Today, I don't want to.
(beat)
Although I did bloody tell you.
Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.
They head for the lift.
ALFRED
I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
Your accomplice.
WAYNE
Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.
They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.

INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC. Dent is at
the podium. Wayne sits in the crowd.
DENT
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for
coming. I've called this press
conference for two reasons. Firstly,
to assure the citizens of Gotham that
everything that can be done over the
Joker killing is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman has
offered to turn himself inThe crowd REACTSHECKLER
So where is he?!
DENT
But first. Let's consider the
situation: should we give in to this
terrorist's demands? Do we really
think thatREPORTER
You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of
citizens?!
The crowd noisily assents. Dent calmly motions quiet.
DENT
The Batman is an outlaw...
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.
DENT (O.S.)

streets for us until nowINT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS

And I promise you, the dawn is
coming.
(the crowd quiets)
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken- but
to us, not to this madman.
The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANTCOP HECKLER
NO MORE DEAD COPS!!
Appreciative noise.
REPORTER
WHERE IS THE BATMAN?
People take up the chant. Dent has lost them. He knows it.
DENT
So be it.

Take the Batman into custody.
At this, a HUSH DESCENDS. Wayne is sitting towards the back.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Rachel comes up to Alfred. Upset.
RACHEL
Why is he letting Harvey do this,
Alfred?
ALFRED
I don't know. He went down to the
press conferenceRACHEL
And just stood by?!
ALFRED
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent
believe that Batman stands for
something more important than a
terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even
if everyone hates him for it.
72.
DENT (cont'd)
(MORE)
That's the sacrifice he's making- to
not be a hero. To be something more.
RACHEL
Well, you're right about one thingletting Harvey take the fall is not
heroic.
Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.
RACHEL
You know Bruce best, Alfred... give
it to him when the time is right.
ALFRED
How will I know?
RACHEL
It's not sealed.
Alfred takes the envelope. Rachel gives him a kiss.
RACHEL
Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED
Goodbye, Rachel.
INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING
A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.
DENT
I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk
this through with you.
RACHEL
Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.

holding. This is the Joker's chance,
and when he attacks, Batman will take
him down.
RACHEL
No. This is too dangerousThe Detective knocks. Dent rises.

Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it. Looks. Heads.
DENT
(sincere)
I'm not.
She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED. She looks up- the
DOORS CLOSE on his smile. She shakes her head. Torn.

Then why do you want to kill me?
The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so
hard it sounds like SOBBING.
THE JOKER
Kill you? I don't want to kill you.
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No
you...
(points)
You. Complete. Me.
BATMAN
You're garbage who kills for money.

Don't talk like one of them- you're

just need you right now.
He regards Batman with something approaching pity.
THE JOKER
But as soon as they don't, they'll
cast you out like a leper.
The Joker looks into Batman's eyes. Searching.
THE JOKER
Their morals, their code... it's a
bad joke. Dropped at the first sign

Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face. HARD.
BATMAN
WHERE ARE THEY?!
The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger. Loving it.
THE JOKER
...you choose one life over the
other. Your friend, the district
attorney. Or his blushing bride-tobe.
Batman PUNCHES the Joker again. The Joker LAUGHS.
THE JOKER
You have nothing. Nothing to
threaten me with. Nothing to do with
all your strength...
(spits a tooth)
But don't worry, I'm going to tell
you where they are. Both of them,
and that's the point- you'll have to
choose.
The Batman stares at the Joker...

dingy, unfurnished basement apartment.
DENT
Rachel? Rachel is that you?
RACHEL
(sobbing)
Harvey. You're OK. I thought...
Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.
DENT
It's OK, Rachel. Everything's going

He looks around. Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a
car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.

THE JOKER
I want my phone call.

STEPHENS
That's nice.
THE JOKER
How many of your friends have I
killed?
STEPHENS
I'm a twenty year man. I can tell
the difference between punks who need
a little lesson in manners, and the

it.

Dent strains... THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING
OVER A BARREL.
RACHEL
Harvey? What's happening?
Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor,
watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around himDENT

The Joker sits like a kid kept after class. He smiles.
THE JOKER
You know why I use a knife,
Detective? Guns are too quick. You
don't get to savor all the little
emotions. See, in their last
moments, people show you who they
really are...
Stephens tries hard to ignore him. It isn't working.
THE JOKER
So, in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.
(smiles)
Would you like to know which of them
were really cowards?

The Detectives look at each other. One of them pulls out his

Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the cowl
and gauntlets lying on the cold marble. He approaches Wayne,
half-undressed, slumped in a chair watching Gotham.
ALFRED
I prepared a little breakfast.
Nothing. Alfred sets down the tray. The envelope is propped
against the silver teapot.
ALFRED
Very well.
WAYNE
Alfred?
ALFRED
Yes, Master Wayne?
Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.

WAYNE
Did I bring this on us? On her? I
thought I would inspire good, not
madnessALFRED
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the face of Gotham's criminalsdidn't you think there might be
casualties? Things were always going
to have to get worse before they got
better.
WAYNE
But Rachel, Alfred...

Rachel believed in what you stood
for. What we stand for.
Wayne looks up at Alfred. Alfred picks up the cowl.
ALFRED

WAYNE
Gotham needs its hero. And I let the
Joker blow him half to hellALFRED
Which is why for now, they'll have to
make do with you.
Alfred hands him the cowl. Wayne looks at him.

She was going to wait for me. Dent
doesn't know. He can never know...
Alfred glances at the envelope. Takes it off the tray.
WAYNE
What's that?
ALFRED
It can wait.
Alfred puts the envelope in his pocket.

STARES at the scarred face. Starts ripping his bandages.

lawyer for a prestigious consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right

Remember the name you all had for me

DENT
SAY IT!
Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch. He looks away. Ashamed.
GORDON

Two-face. Harvey two-face.
Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is
DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled. Molars visible.
The eye a ball and socket. Dent manages a small smile with
the good side of his face.
DENT
Why should I hide who I am?
GORDON
I... I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up- was
he working for them?

They pass into a huge hold. In the middle: A BILLION
DOLLARS. The pile is thirty feet high. Standing on top- the
Joker. At his feet, bound, is Lau. The Chechen laughs.
CHECHEN
Like I say- not so crazy as you look.
The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.
THE JOKER
I told you- I'm a man of my word.
(looks around)
Where's the Italian?
The Chechen shrugs. Pulls out a cigar. Lights it.
CHECHEN
More for us. What you do with all
your money, Mr.Joker?
The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.
THE JOKER
I'm a man of simple tastes. I like
gunpowder. Dynamite...
He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.
THE JOKER
...gasoline...
The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards. The Joker turns. JABS
his gun in the Chechen's face. The Chechen's bodyguards
REACT. The Joker's men DRAW on them.
THE JOKER
And you know what they have in
common? They're cheap.
CHECHEN
You said you were a man of your word.
The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.
THE JOKER
I am.
The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.
THE JOKER
I'm only burning my half.
100.
The Chechen watches the money catch fire.
THE JOKER
All you care about is money. This
city deserves a better class of
criminal, and I'm going to give it to
them. This is my town now. Tell
your men they work for me.
The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs. They GROWL.
CHECHEN
They won't work for a freak.
The Joker takes out a knife. Tosses it to his man.
THE JOKER
Cut him up and offer him to his
little Princes. Let's show him just
how loyal a hungry dog is.
The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.
THE JOKER
It's not about money. It's about
sending a message...

The Joker pulls out a phone...

Reese has a confident air. Engel is taking calls.
CALLER 1 (O.S.)
I wanna how much they're gonna pay
you to say who Batman really is.
REESE
That's simply not why I'm doing this.
ENGEL
Caller, you're on the air.
CALLER 2 (O.S.)
Harvey dent didn't want us to give in
to this maniac- you think you know
better than him?
ENGEL
Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want
Batman to give himself up, is this
the right thing to do?

REESE
If we could talk to Dent now he might
feel differentlyENGEL
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him, now. Let's
take another callOLD LADY (O.S.)
Mr.Reese, what's more valuable: one
life, or a hundred?
REESE
I guess it would depend on the life.
OLD LADY (O.S.)
OK. Let's say it's your life. Is it
worth more than the lives of several
hundred others?
REESE
Of course not.
OLD LADY (O.S.)
I'm glad you feel that way. Because
I've put a bomb in one of the city's
hospitals. It's going off in sixty
minutes unless someone kills you.
ENGEL
Who is this?
OLD (O.S.)
Just a concerned citizen-

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker. A
Detective turns up the TV in the bullpenTHE JOKER (O.S.)
I had a vision. Of a world without
Batman. The mob ground out a little
profit and the police tried to shut
them down, one block at a time...
and it was so... boring. I've had a
change of heart. I don't want
Mr.Reese spoiling everything, but why
should I have all the fun? Let's
give someone else a chance...
Reese looks around, twitching. Sweating.
102.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty
minutes, then I blow up a hospital.
Of course, you could always kill
yourself, Mr.Reese. But that would
be the noble thing to do. And you're
a lawyer.
The line rings off. Engel is speechless.
Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.
GORDON
Call in every officer- tell them to
head to their nearest hospital and
start evac and search. Call the
transit authority, school board,
prisons- get every available bus down
to a hospital- the priority is Gotham
General- wheel everybody out of that
place right now- my hunch is that's
where the bomb is.
DETECTIVE MURPHY
Why?
GORDON
That's where Harvey Dent is.

The young cop, BERG, looks up. Sweating.
BERG

Berg nods. Looks at his watch.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed. Dent STRAINS at the
leather cuffs binding him to the bed.
THE JOKER
I don't want there to be any hard
feelings between us, Harvey.
The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.
THE JOKER
When you and Rachel were being
abducted I was sitting in Gordon's
cage. I didn't rig those chargesDENT
Your men. Your plan.
THE JOKER
Do I really look like a guy with a
plan, Harvey? I don't have a
plan...The mob has plans, the cops
have plans. You know what I am,
Harvey?
106.
Dent's hand is TREMBLING.
THE JOKER
I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't
know what to do with one if I caught
it. I just do things. I'm just the
wrench in the gears. I hate plans.
Yours, theirs, everyone's. Maroni
has plans. Gordon has plans.
Schemers trying to control their
worlds. I'm not a schemer, I show
the schemers how pathetic their
attempts to control things really
are. So when I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal, you
know I'm telling the truth...
Hands him the pistol. Dent holds it to the Joker's head.

What?

Wayne watches the driver of the pickup staring intently at

BERG
Why? Because my wife's in hospital?
GORDON
Yeah. That would be why.
107.
INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.
THE JOKER
It's the schemers who put you where
you are. You were a schemer. You
had plans. Look where it got you. I
just did what I do best- I took your
plan, and I turned it on itself.
Look what I've done to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of
bullets. Nobody panics when the
expected people get killed. Nobody
panics when things go according to
plan, even if the plan is horrifying.
If I tell the press that tomorrow a
gangbanger will get shot, or a
truckload of soldiers will be blown
up, nobody panics. Because it's all
part of the plan. But when I say
that one little old mayor will die,
everybody loses their minds!
Introduce a little anarchy, you upset
the established order and everything
becomes chaos. I'm an agent of
chaos. And you know the thing about
chaos, Harvey?
Dent looks into the Joker's eyes. Finding meaning.
THE JOKER
It's fair.
Dent looks down at the coin in his hands. Turns it over,
feels it's comforting weight. Shows the Joker the good side.
DENT
You live.
He turns the coin over. The flip side is deeply SCARRED.
DENT
You die.
The Joker looks at the coin. Looks at Dent, admiringly.
THE JOKER
Now you're talking.
Dent FLICKS the coin into the air. Catches it. Looks.

Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon
crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne

Wayne looks at him, woozy. Sits on the curb.
WAYNE
Call me Bruce. I think so.
GORDON
That was a brave thing, you did.
WAYNE
Trying to catch the light?
GORDON
You weren't protecting the van?
Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.
Reese steps down, dazed.
WAYNE
Why? Who's in it?
Reese locks eyes with Wayne. Nods. Gordon sizes up Bruce
Wayne and his crushed sports car.
GORDON
You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr.Wayne?
109.
WAYNE
(shrugs)
It can get a little intense. Think I
should go to hospital?
GORDON
Not today, I wouldn't.
INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.
As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket. Strolling
along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST INTO
THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the Joker
just walks out the door...
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIESPeople DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school busThe Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING
COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...

All eyes are on the collapsed building. One school bus pulls
out from the line of other buses. Heads down the street.
INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY
An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at the
bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.
BARTENDER
Sweet Jesus. D'you see this, Mike?
They blew up a hospital...
110.
Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.
BARTENDER
Shouldn't you be out there, you know,
doing something?
WUERTZ
It's my day off.
The Bartender shuts the register.
BARTENDER
I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on
things, will ya?
The Bartender steps out. The back door OPENS again.
WUERTZ
What? You need me to shake it forHe TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey
Dent. Standing in shadow. He sits.
DENT
Hello.
WUERTZ
Dent, I thought you was...dead...
Dent leans into the light. The left side of his face is
HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.
DENT
Half.
Dent picks up Wuertz's drink. Takes a SIP. Wuertz watches
the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.
DENT
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
WUERTZ
It must've been Maroni's menDent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.
DENT
You, of all people, are gonna protect
the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
WUERTZ
I don't know- he'd never tell me.
(stares at Dent)
I swear to God, I didn't know what
they were gonna do to you111.
DENT
Funny, I don't know what's going to
happen to you, either.
Dent pulls his coin from his pocket. FLIPS it. Wuertz
watches it SPIN. It lands on the table. Scarred side up.
The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.
EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY
Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a CopGORDON
You must know how many were insideyou've got patient lists, roll callsCOP
Sir! Sir. Take a look at what we're
dealing with. Cops, National Guard-
(gestures at buses)
We're showing 50 missing- but that
building was clear. These buses are
heading off to other hospitals- my
guess is we missed one.
GORDON
Yeah? What's your guess about where
Harvey Dent is?
The cop says nothing.
GORDON
Keep looking. Keep it to yourself.
INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY
Fox is watching the news. His intercom buzzes.
VOICE (O.S.)
Mr.Fox? Security is showing a breakin at the R and D department.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox watches two security men force the door. He enters
alone.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox enters the dimly-lit room. At one end is an
extraordinary array of thousands of tiny monitors. Fox
approaches, fascinated, as they quietly display architectural
patterns individually and in concert. The images become a
MAP.
BATMAN
Beautiful. Isn't it?
112.
Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.
FOX
Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous.
You've turned every phone in the city
into a microphone...
Lucius presses a key. The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS
at once fills the room. Every cell phone in the city.
BATMAN
And high frequency
generator/receiver.
FOX
Like the phone I gave you in Hong
Kong. You took my sonar concept and
applied it to everybody's phone in
the City. With half the city feeding
you sonar you can image all of
Gotham.
(turns to Batman)
This is wrong.
BATMAN
I've got to find this man, Lucius.
FOX
But at what cost?
BATMAN
The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one
person.
FOX
No one should have that kind of
power.
WAYNE
That's why I gave it to you. Only
you can use it.
Lucius looks at Batman. Hard.
FOX
Spying on thirty million people
wasn't in my job description.
Batman points to a TV screen. Fox turns. ON SCREEN: the
Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...
THE JOKER
What does it take to make you people
want to join in..?
113.
EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches a screen. Grave.
THE JOKER
You failed to kill the lawyer... I've
got to get you off the bench and into
the game. So, here it is...
INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
The bar, packed with business people watches the TV. SILENT.
THE JOKER
Come nightfall, this city is mine,
and anyone left here plays by my
rules. If you don't want to be in
the game, get out now.
Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the cameraTHE JOKER
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are
in for a surprise.
CUT TO STATIC. The bar patrons look around, confused.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.
BATMAN
Trust me.
Fox stares at Batman.
BATMAN
This is the audio sample.
He plugs a USB dongle into the console. A sample of the
Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.
BATMAN
If he talks within range of any phone
in the city, you'll be able to
triangulate his position.
Lucius toggles a menu. The city is an open book- People
working, eating, sleeping. Lucius shakes his head.
BATMAN
When you've finished, type your name
to switch it off.
FOX
I'll help you this one time...
Lucius sits at the console. Batman moves off114.
FOX
But consider this my resignation.
Batman turns. Fox looks at him, serious.
FOX
As long as this machine is at Wayne
Industries, I won't be.
EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK
Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car... the
BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search
teams.
INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon briefs the Mayor.
GORDON
My officers are going over every inch
of the tunnels and bridges, but with
the Joker's threat they're not and
option.
MAYOR
Land routes East?
GORDON
Backed up for hours. Which leaves
the ferries with thirty thousand
waiting to board. Plus, corrections
are at capacity, so I want to use a
ferry to take some prisoners off the
island.
MAYOR
The men you and Dent put away? Those
aren't people I'm worried about.
GORDON
You should be- they're the people you
least want to be stuck with in an
emergency. Whatever the Joker's
planning, it's a good bet that
Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I want 'em out of here.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the
THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the
two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters. Grumbles turn to YELLS
as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.
115.
CIVILIAN
That ain't right! We should be on
that boat.
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
You want to ride across with them, be
my guest.
EXT. BROWNSTONE -- DUSK
Maroni climbs into the back of a limo.
INT. LIMO -- DUSK
Maroni settles back into his seat. The car pulls away.
MARONI
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
DENT
Going to join your wife?
Maroni STARTS. Someone is in here with him. Harvey DentTwo Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.
DENT
You love her?
MARONI
Yes.
DENT
Can you imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?
MARONI
Take it up with the Joker. He killed
your woman. Made you... like this...
DENT
The Joker's just a mad dog. I want
whoever let him off the leash.
Maroni looks at Dent. Worried.
DENT
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel? It must've
been someone she trusted.
MARONI
If I tell you, will you let me go?
DENT
It can't hurt your chances.
116.
MARONI
It was Ramirez.
Pulls out his coin. Dent cocks the pistol...
MARONI
But you saidDENT
I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
Dent FLIPS it. Looks: good side. He shrugs.
DENT
Lucky guy.
Maroni looks confused. Dent FLIPS the coin again. Looks
down at the coin. Shakes his head.
DENT
But he's not.
MARONI
Who?
Dent smiles. PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.
DENT
Your driver.
Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of
the driver. Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING. Dent FIRES.
EXT. BRIDGE -- DUSK
The Limo SWERVES off of the bridge, SOARS out over the canal,
and PANCAKES into the RETAINING WALL.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
CIVILIANS CRAM their way onto one ferry. Finally, the

The two FERRIES set off across the river, heading for the
lights of the distant shore of the mainland.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DIESEL FUEL. And a small, wrapped
PRESENT, topped with a BOW.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present. His
radio CRACKLES.

Same thing over here- enough diesel
to blow us sky high. And a present.
EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS
Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing. Listening.
BATMAN
Fox? There's something going on on
the ferries...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
UNWRAPS that ferry's present. Inside, he finds a crude
REMOTE DETONATOR.
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?
Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to the
P.A. rings and answers.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
Tonight, you're all going to be part
of a social experiment.
ON BOTH FERRIES: CIVILIANS, PRISONERS, CREW, AND NATIONAL

Lucius Fox looks up as the console CHIMES.
FOX
I'm zeroing in.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
Through the magic of diesel fuel and
ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now

attempts to get off their boat, you
all die...
FOX
His voice is on the ferry, but that's
not the source...
EXT. ROOFTOPS ABOVE GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Batman looks out, across the entire city skyline.
BATMAN
Do you have a location on the Joker?
FOX
It's west...
Batman FIRES UP the bat-pod- his cape SHRINKS into its pack
form as he PEELS OUT, ROARING into the night.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
But we're going to make things a
little more interesting than that.
Tonight, we're going to learn a
little bit about ourselves...

Ramirez nods.
DENT
She trusts you. Just like Rachel
did.
RAMIREZ
I didn't knowDENT
'What they were gonna do'? You're
the second cop to say that to me.
What, exactly, did you think they
were going to do?
RAMIREZ
I'm sorry- they got me early on. My
mother's medical bills and myDENT
Don't!
Dent FLIPS his coin.
RAMIREZ
I took a little from them- once
they've got you, they keep you. I'm
sorry.
Dent looks at his coin. Good side.
120.
DENT
Live to fight another day, officer.
Dent CRACKS her on the head with his gun.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio. It's DEAD.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
He killed the radio.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
There's no need for all of you to
die. That would be a waste. So I've
left you both a little present.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries.
Talking into a cell phone. Holding a detonator, with TWO
BUTTONS.
THE JOKER
Each of you has a remote to blow up
the other boat.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen. Appalled.
THE JOKER (O.S.)
At midnight, I blow you all up. If,
however, one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live. You
choose. So who's it going to beHarvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
collection... or the sweet innocent
civilians?
(beat)
Oh, and you might want to decide
quickly, because the people on the
other boat may not be quite so noble.
The Joker HANGS UP. The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down at
the remote in his hands. Prisoners begin YELLING and
PUSHING. The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS
his shotgun. His men level their weapons at the crowd.

passengers take a step towards him. He PULLS his weapon.
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
Stay back.
A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.
BUSINESSMAN
Who are you to decide? We ought to
talk it over, at least.
Other passengers agree. A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.
MOTHER
We don't all have to die. Why should
my babies die? Those men had their
chanceNATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
We're not talking about this...
PASSENGER 1
They're talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat.
PASSENGER 2
If they're even bothering to talk.
Let's put it to a vote.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
As the Prisoners grow angrier, a CORRECTIONS OFFICER FIRES
his shotgun into the air. The Prisoners back off. Slightly.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
A GUARDSMAN on this boat passes around a hat. People drop
CHITS into it. Passengers filling out chits eye each other.
People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.
The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks out across the water to the
other Ferry. Looks up at the clock. Ten to midnight...
STARES down at his blank chit.

Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.
GORDON
Then we have a hostage situation.
They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt
Building. The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS
are clearly visible, automatic weapons in hand.
SWAT SNIPER
I got hostages!
They look through his scope. Crouched deeper in the room,
PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.
GORDON
It's a shooting gallery. Why'd he
choose a spot with such big windows?
BATMAN
He likes the view.
Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.
SWAT LEADER
We have clear shots on five clowns.
Snipers take them out, smash the
windows- a team rappels in, a team
moves in by the stairwells. 2 or 3
or three casualties, max.
GORDON
(barely hesitates)
Let's do it.
BATMAN
It's not that simple. With the
Joker, it never is.
GORDON
What's simple, is that every second
we don't take him, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing
each other up!
123.
BATMAN
That won't happen.
GORDON
Then he'll blow them both up!
There's no time- we have to go in nowBATMAN
There's always a catch with himGORDON
That's why we can't wait- we can't

Batman RIPS off the clown mask:

Batman indicates the clock... twelve o'clock.
BATMAN
What were you hoping to prove? That
deep down, we're all as ugly as you?
The Joker looks at the clock...
INT. BOTH FERRIES -- CONTINUOUS
The Passengers brace. Look at the clock. Confused...
INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
The smile disappears from the Joker's face.
BATMAN
You're alone.
The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and
arms. Shows him the remote.
THE JOKER
Can't rely on anyone these days.
The Joker ARMS the remote...
THE JOKER
Have to do everything yourself. I
always have- and it's not always
easy...
130.

(smiles, remembering)
You know how I got these scars?
Batman looks up at him.
BATMAN
No. But I know how you get theseBatman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing the
Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, freed,
leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the remoteThe Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride. Something
SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE.
The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.
THE JOKER
Just couldn't let me go, could you?
I guess this is what happens when an
unstoppable force meets an immovable
object. You truly are incorruptible,
aren't you?
Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN. The Joker is LAUGHING.
THE JOKER
You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of selfrighteousness... and I won't kill you
because you're too much fun. We're
going to do this forever.
BATMAN
You'll be in a padded cell, forever.
THE JOKER
Maybe we can share it. They'll need
to double up, the rate this city's
inhabitants are losing their minds...
BATMAN
This city just showed you it's full
of people ready to believe in good.
The Joker looks up at him. A twinkle in his eye.
THE JOKER
Till their spirit breaks completely.
Until they find out what I did with
the best of them. Until they get a
good look at the real Harvey Dent,
and all the heroic things he's done.
(indicates ferry)
Then those criminals will be straight
back onto the streets and Gotham will
understand the true nature of
heroism.
(off look)
131.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
(MORE)
You didn't think I'd risk losing the
battle for the soul of Gotham in a
fist fight with you? You've got to
have an ace in the hole. Mine's
Harvey.
Batman hauls the Joker up, nose to nose.
BATMAN
What did you do?
THE JOKER
I took Gotham's white knight. And I
brought him down to my level. It
wasn't hard- madness is like gravity.
All it takes is a little push.
Joker laughs. Batman leaves him to the SWATS.
BATMAN
Lucius. Find Harvey Dent.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT
Gordon gets out of his car, gun drawn. Makes his way into
the blackened wreck of a building...
INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT
Gordon peers into the darkness.
GORDON
Dent?
No reply. Gordon makes his way deeper. Up the stairs.
INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together.
He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her headWHAM! Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun. Dent
disarms Gordon, rolls him over. He turns to look at the
ENORMOUS hole in the floor. From this side, in the
moonlight, Dent looks completely normal.
DENT
This is where they brought her,
Gordon. After your people handed her
over. This is where they bound her.
This is where she suffered. This is
where she died.
GORDON
I know. I was here. Trying to save
her.
Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.
132.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
DENT
But you didn't, did you?
GORDON
I couldn't.
DENT
Yes, you could.
DENT
If you'd listened to me- if you'd
stood up against corruption instead
of doing your deal with the devil.
GORDON
I was trying to fight the mobDent MOVES towards Gordon.
DENT
You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you love most, wondering if
you're about to listen to them die?
You ever had to lie to that person?
Tell them it's going to be all right,
when you know it's not? Well, you're
about to find out what that feels
like. Then you'll be able to look me
in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her templeGORDON
Harvey. Put the gun down. You're
not going to hurt my family.
DENT
No, just the person you need most.
(cocks gun)
So is it your wife?
GORDON
Put the gun down.
Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.
GORDON
Please, Harvey...
Dent moves to James Gordon. Brushes the hair out of the
boy's eyes with the muzzle. Gordon SNAPS.
GORDON
Goddamit. Stop pointing that gun at
my family, Dent.
133.
DENT
We have a winner.
Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.
BARBARA
No! Jim stop him! Don't let him!
Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.
He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.
GORDON
I'm sorry, Harvey. For everything.
But, please. Please don't hurt him.
SIRENS.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Cop cars descend on the warehouse.
INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.
DENT
You brought your cops?
GORDON
All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who, or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.
DENT
You think I want to escape?! There's
no escape from thisDent indicates his face. His suffering.
GORDON
No one needs to escape, because no
one's done anything wrong. And
nobody has to.
Dent chuckles. A macabre sight.
DENT
I've done plenty wrong, Gordon. Just
not quite enough. Yet.
Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little
boy's neck. The boy WHIMPERS.
BATMAN
You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.
Dent turns. Batman steps from the shadows.
134.
DENT
It's not about what I want. It's
about what's fair.
(to Gordon and Batman)
You thought we could be decent men in
an indecent world. You thought we
could lead by example. You thought
the rules could be bent but not
break... you were wrong. The world
is cruel.
(shows his coin)
And the only morality in a cruel
world is chance. Unbiased.
Unprejudiced. Fair.
BATMAN
Nothing fair ever came out of the
barrel of a gun, Dent.
DENT
(shows the coin)
His boy's got the same chance she
had. Fifty-fifty.
Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.
BATMAN
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act. We
three. We knew the risks and we
acted as one. We are all responsible
for the consequences.
Dent looks at Batman. Pleading.
DENT
Then why was it only me who lost
everything?
Batman looks into Dent's eyes. Emotional.
BATMAN
It wasn't.
DENT
(furious)
The Joker chose me!
BATMAN
Because you were the best of us. He
wanted to prove that even someone as
good as you could fall.
DENT
(bitter)
And he was right.
135.
BATMAN
But your fooling yourself if you
think you're letting chance decide.
You're the one pointing the gun,
Harvey. So point it at the people
who were responsible. We all acted
as one. Gordon. Me. And you.
Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.
DENT
Fair enough.
Dent eases his grip on the boy.
DENT
You first.
He points the gun at Batman. FLIPS the coin. TAILS. He
SHOOTS. Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.
DENT
My turn.
He points the gun at his own head. FLIPS the coin. HEADS.
He looks a little disappointed.
Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.
DENT
Your turn, Gordon.
GORDON
You're right, Harvey. Rachel's death
was my fault. But punish meDENT
I'm about to. Tell your son it's
going to be all right, Gordon. Lie.
Like I lied.
Gordon looks up. Pained. Locks eyes with his son.
GORDON
It's going to be all right, son.
Dent FLIPS the coin. High. Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin upBatman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.
All three of them VANISH over the edge. A TERRIBLE CRASHthen silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on
the floor at the edge of the hole.
Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers downDent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken. DEAD.
The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.
136.
Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is
holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...
Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...
Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH
protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.
EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
The cops prepare to STORM the front door.
INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon races down the stairs. Rushes over to Batman.
JAMES
Dad, is he okay?
Gordon crouches at Batman's side. The Batman GRASPS Gordon's
arm. STAGGERS to his feet.
GORDON
Thank-you.
BATMAN
You don't have toGORDON
Yes, I do.
Gordon and Batman stare down at Dent's body. Grave.
GORDON
The Joker won.
Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.
GORDON
Harvey's prosecution, everything he
fought for, everything Rachel died
for. Undone. Whatever chance Gotham
had of fixing itself... whatever
chance you gave us of fixing our
city... dies with Harvey's
reputation. We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best of us and
tore him down. People will lose all
hope.
BATMAN
No. They won't.
(looks at Gordon)
They can never know what he did.
137.
GORDON
(incredulous)
Five dead? Two of them cops? We
can't sweep that underBATMAN
No. But the Joker cannot win.
Batman crouches to Dent's body.
BATMAN
Gotham needs its true hero.
Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is
up. Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman. Understanding.
GORDON
You? You can'tBATMAN
Yes, I can.
Batman stands. Faces Gordon.
BATMAN
You either die a hero or live long
enough to see yourself become the
villain. I can do those things
because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I
killed those people. That's what I
can be.
GORDON
(angry)
No, you can't! You're not!
Batman hands Gordon his police radio.
BATMAN
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

GORDON
Because...
EXT. DOCKSIDE ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS
The Batman LURCHES between shipping containers. STUMBLING.
BLEEDING. He makes it to the bat-pod...
GORDON (V.O.)
...he's the hero Gotham deserves...
but not the one it needs right now.
So we'll hunt him, because he can
take it. Because he's not our
hero...
The bat-pod streaks through Gotham's underground streets, the
Batman's cape fluttering behind. A wraith...
GORDON (V.O.)
...he's a silent guardian, a watchful
protector... a dark knight.
The Batman races up a ramp into a blinding lightCUT TO BLACK.
